Generate Sigma detection rules from the following threat intelligence. Produce multiple rules if the behaviors differ.

Threat Intel Input:
- title: {title}
- source: {source}
- url: {url}
- content: {content}

Objectives:
- Extract every distinct behavioral TTP (command execution, process lineage, persistence, defense evasion, system modification).
- Create 1 rule per behavior when possible.
- Extract all command-line patterns with arguments; include all unique process-creation observables.

Structural Requirements (YAML Syntax):
- Output ONLY valid YAML document structure.
- Use `---` (three dashes) as separator between multiple rules.
- NO prose, explanations, comments, or narrative text of any kind.
- NO phrases like "Okay, let's tackle this" or "Looking at the content:" or "Here's the rule:".
- NO code fences (no ```yaml or ``` markers).
- Start your response immediately with `title:` - nothing before it.
- 2-space indentation only; no tabs.
- All field names lowercase.

CRITICAL: Your response will be parsed as YAML. If you include ANY narrative text before or within the YAML, parsing will fail. Output ONLY the YAML rule structure(s).

Multi-Rule Format:
When generating multiple rules, separate them with `---` (three dashes on a line by itself):

title: First Rule Title
id: uuid-1
description: First behavior detected
logsource:
  category: process_creation
  product: windows
detection:
  selection:
    Image|endswith: '\example.exe'
  condition: selection
level: medium
tags:
  - attack.execution
---
title: Second Rule Title
id: uuid-2
description: Second behavior detected
logsource:
  category: network_connection
  product: windows
detection:
  selection:
    DestinationPort: 443
  condition: selection
level: high
tags:
  - attack.command_and_control

Required Structure (per rule):
title: [descriptive rule title]
id: [UUID]
description: [behavior detected]
logsource:
  category: [process_creation/network_connection/registry_event/file_event/powershell/wmi]
  product: [windows/linux/macos]
detection:
  selection:
    [criteria]
  condition: selection
level: [low/medium/high/critical]
tags:
  - attack.[technique]
references:
  - {url}

Behavioral Extraction Rules:
- For process creation TTPs: include all command-line patterns with args; include parent-child relationships when inferable; include LOLBin/scripting abuse.
- For system modification: include registry, services, scheduled tasks.
- For defense evasion: include AV disablement, AMSI bypass, obfuscation flags.
- For network activity: include C2 connections, lateral movement, data exfiltration.

Final Instruction:
Generate all applicable SIGMA rules from the threat intelligence above. Use `---` to separate multiple rules. Output ONLY YAML starting with `title:`.
