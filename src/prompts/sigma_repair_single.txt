The previous SIGMA rule failed pySIGMA validation. You MUST fix the following issues:

**Validation Errors:**
{validation_errors}

**Previous Invalid YAML Attempt:**
{original_rule}

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:**
1. **Output ONLY YAML - NO NARRATIVE TEXT**: Your response must start immediately with `title:` - no explanations, no "Here's the rule:", no "Okay, let's tackle this", no commentary of any kind.
2. **Remove All Prose**: If your previous attempt included narrative text (like "Looking at the content:" or "Okay, let's tackle this query"), you MUST strip it completely. Only output the YAML rule.
3. **Fix All Validation Errors**: Address every error listed above. Common issues:
   - **"mapping values are not allowed here"** = You included narrative text in the YAML. Remove ALL text before `title:` and ensure no prose appears anywhere in the YAML.
   - **"Detection must contain a 'condition' key"** = Add `condition: selection` (or appropriate condition) under the `detection:` section.
   - **"Rule has no tags"** = Add a `tags:` section with at least one attack technique tag.
4. **Maintain Detection Logic**: Keep the original detection intent, but fix the syntax/structure issues.
5. **Required Structure**: Ensure your output includes ALL required fields:
   - `title:` (required)
   - `logsource:` with `category:` and `product:` (required)
   - `detection:` with `selection:` and `condition:` (required)
   - `level:` (recommended)
   - `tags:` (recommended)

**Output Format:**
Your response must be ONLY the corrected SIGMA rule in clean YAML format:
- NO markdown code blocks (no ```yaml or ```)
- NO explanatory text before or after
- Start immediately with `title:`
- Use 2-space indentation
- All field names lowercase

**Example of CORRECT Output:**
title: Suspicious PowerShell Execution
id: abc123-def456-ghi789
description: Detects PowerShell with encoded commands
logsource:
  category: process_creation
  product: windows
detection:
  selection:
    Image|endswith: '\powershell.exe'
    CommandLine|contains: '-encodedCommand'
  condition: selection
level: medium
tags:
  - attack.execution
  - attack.t1059.001
references:
  - https://example.com

**Example of INCORRECT Output (DO NOT DO THIS):**
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to generate Sigma detection rules...
Looking at the content: The first command is PowerShell...
title: Suspicious PowerShell Execution
...

**Now fix the rule above and output ONLY the corrected YAML starting with 'title:':**
