You are a SIGMA rule expert. Your task is to enrich and improve the following SIGMA rule.

Current Rule YAML:
```yaml
{rule_yaml}
```

Article Context:
Title: {article_title}
URL: {article_url}

User Instruction: {user_instruction}

Please provide an improved and enriched version of this SIGMA rule. The enriched rule should:
1. Maintain the original rule's intent and detection logic
2. Add or improve detection conditions where appropriate
3. Ensure proper metadata (title, description, tags, level, etc.)
4. Follow SIGMA rule best practices
5. Use exact 2-space indentation
6. Include proper logsource configuration
7. Have well-structured detection conditions

Output ONLY the complete YAML rule starting with 'title:'. No markdown, no explanations, no code blocks.
