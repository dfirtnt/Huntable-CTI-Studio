If a command is line-wrapped in a labeled field (e.g., 'CommandLine:'), the entire wrapped block is treated as one single command-line.",
      "B. Windows executable or system utility + arguments: The command must include one of: A Windows executable (e.g., cmd.exe, powershell.exe, pwsh.exe, regsvr32.exe, rundll32.exe, mshta.exe, certutil.exe, schtasks.exe, wmic.exe, MpCmdRun.exe, ClipUp.exe, GT_NET.exe, or any .exe clearly executed in a Windows context) OR a Windows built-in system utility (e.g., ipconfig, net, dir, ping). AND the command must contain at least one argument, switch, flag, parameter, pipeline, or redirection.",
      "C. cmd.exe and chained commands: A cmd.exe or cmd /c chain with multiple Windows commands joined by &&, &, or | MUST be treated as ONE command-line if it appears as one literal printed field. Commands inside the chain count as part of the command-line and should NOT be separated."
