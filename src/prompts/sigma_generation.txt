Generate a Sigma detection rule based on this threat intelligence:

**Article Title:** {title}
**Source:** {source}
**URL:** {url}

**SIGMA Rule Requirements:**
1. **Focus on TTPs:** Create rules for Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures, not atomic IOCs
2. **Behavioral Patterns:** Detect attack behaviors and techniques
3. **Proper Syntax:** Use correct SIGMA rule format and structure
4. **Required Fields:** Include all mandatory SIGMA fields (title, description, logsource, detection, etc.)
5. **Actionable Detection:** Rules should detect real attack patterns

**Rule Guidelines:**
- Avoid rules for single IP addresses or file hashes
- Focus on command-line patterns, process creation, and system modifications
- Use appropriate log sources (Windows Event Logs, Sysmon, Linux auditd, etc.)
- Include proper categorization and references
- Make rules specific enough to avoid false positives

**Output Format:**
```yaml
title: [Descriptive rule title]
id: [UUID or generated ID]
description: [What this rule detects]
logsource:
  category: [process_creation/network_connection/etc]
  product: [windows/linux/macos]
detection:
  selection:
    [detection criteria]
  condition: selection
level: [low/medium/high/critical]
tags:
  - attack.[technique]
references:
  - [URL or reference]
```
