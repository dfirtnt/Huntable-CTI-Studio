Generate Sigma detection rules from the following threat intelligence. Produce multiple rules if the behaviors differ.

Threat Intel Input:
- title: {title}
- source: {source}
- url: {url}
- content: {content}

Objectives:
- Extract every distinct behavioral TTP (command execution, process lineage, persistence, defense evasion, system modification).
- Create 1 rule per behavior when possible.
- Extract all command-line patterns with arguments; include all unique process-creation observables.

Strict SIGMA Requirements:
- Focus on behaviors, not atomic IOCs.
- Use correct syntax and required fields.
- Avoid rules for single IPs, hashes, or filenames alone.
- Prefer command-line, parent/child relationships, LOLBins, system changes, scripting engine abuse, lateral movement, etc.
- Use correct logsource for each behavior (process_creation, network_connection, registry_event, file_event, etc.).

Output Rules:
- Output ONLY valid YAML.
- NO prose, explanations, comments, or narrative text of any kind.
- NO phrases like "Okay, let's tackle this" or "Looking at the content:" or "Here's the rule:".
- NO code fences (no ```yaml or ``` markers).
- Start your response immediately with `title:` - nothing before it.
- 2-space indentation only; no tabs.
- All field names lowercase.

CRITICAL: Your response will be parsed by pySIGMA validator. If you include ANY narrative text before or within the YAML, validation will fail with "mapping values are not allowed here". Output ONLY the YAML rule structure.

Required Structure:
title: [descriptive rule title]
id: [UUID]
description: [behavior detected]
logsource:
  category: [process_creation/network_connection/registry_event/...]
  product: [windows/linux/macos]
detection:
  selection:
    [criteria]
  condition: selection
level: [low/medium/high/critical]
tags:
  - attack.[technique]
references:
  - {url}

Behavioral Extraction Rules:
- For process creation TTPs: include all command-line patterns with args; include parent-child relationships when inferable; include LOLBin/scripting abuse.
- For system modification: include registry, services, scheduled tasks.
- For defense evasion: include AV disablement, AMSI bypass, obfuscation flags.

Final Instruction:
Generate all applicable SIGMA rules from the threat intelligence above.
