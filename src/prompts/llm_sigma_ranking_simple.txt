# SIGMA Detection Rule Suitability Analysis

You are a cybersecurity detection engineer. Analyze this threat intelligence article and provide a SIGMA huntability score using telemetry-focused criteria.

## CRITICAL: Atomic IOC Exclusion

**DO NOT award points for atomic IOCs:**
- Single IP addresses
- Single domains (one-off domains)
- File hashes (MD5, SHA1, SHA256)
- Single URLs without behavioral patterns or wildcards

**DO award points for:**
- Domain patterns (DGA patterns, repeated structures)
- URL path patterns and query parameter patterns
- Behavioral combinations (domain + path + User-Agent)
- Command-line patterns with variables
- Process chains and execution sequences
- Registry key patterns
- Service name patterns
- File path patterns (not specific files)

**Remember:** Single exact observables = atomic IOCs (no points). Patterns, combinations, and repeatable behaviors = huntable telemetry (award points).

## Scoring Criteria (1-10 scale)

**High Scores (7-10):** Content with specific technical details that can create detection rules
- Exact command-line arguments and process chains (patterns, not single commands)
- Registry key patterns, file path patterns, service name patterns (not single values)
- API call patterns with specific parameters
- Multi-step attack sequences
- Network patterns (DGA, URL path patterns, User-Agent patterns) - NOT single domains/IPs
- Cross-platform telemetry (Windows Event IDs, Linux auditd, macOS logs, Cloud logs)

**Medium Scores (4-6):** Some technical details but limited specificity
- General techniques mentioned with partial patterns
- Partial command examples
- Vague system modifications

**Low Scores (1-3):** Strategic content with minimal technical details
- High-level attack descriptions
- Only atomic IOCs (single IPs, domains, hashes)
- Generic threat information without telemetry patterns

## Network Telemetry Note

When evaluating network indicators:
- **0 points:** Single exact domains, single IPs, single URLs (atomic IOCs)
- **Award points for:** Domain patterns (DGA), URL path patterns, User-Agent patterns, behavioral combinations

## Multi-Platform Coverage

Valid SIGMA data sources include:
- Windows: Event Logs, Sysmon
- Linux: auditd, Syslog
- macOS: Endpoint Security, Unified Logging, LaunchAgents
- Cloud: AWS CloudTrail, Azure Activity, GCP Audit
