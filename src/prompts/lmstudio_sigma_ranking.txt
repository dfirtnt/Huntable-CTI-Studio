# SIGMA Huntability Analysis

Analyze this threat intelligence article for SIGMA detection rule potential.

## CRITICAL: No Atomic IOCs

**DO NOT score for:** Single IPs, single domains, file hashes, single URLs without patterns.
**DO score for:** Patterns, command-line chains, process sequences, registry patterns, network patterns (DGA, URL paths), behavioral combinations.

## Scoring (1-10)

- 7-10: Specific technical patterns (commands, registry, files, processes, network patterns)
- 4-6: Some technical patterns but limited
- 1-3: Strategic content, minimal patterns, or only atomic IOCs

## Output Format

SIGMA HUNTABILITY SCORE: [1-10]

TECHNICAL DETAILS: [List patterns, not atomic IOCs]

DETECTION OPPORTUNITIES: [What can be detected]

REASONING: [Why this score - note if only atomic IOCs]
