Introduction 
Note: This Malware Analysis Report was originally published Dec. 4, 2025, to share indicators of 
compromise (IOCs) and detection signatures for BRICKSTORM malware. The Cybersecurity and 
Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), National Security Agency (NSA), and Canadian Centre for Cyber 
Security (Cyber Centre) have updated this Malware Analysis Report three times. 
▪ Dec. 19, 2025, with IOCs and detection signatures for three additional BRICKSTORM samples. See 
Appendix C: Dec. 19, 2025, Updates and Table 12. 
▪ Jan. 20, 2026, with detection signatures. See Table 12. 
▪ Feb. 11, 2026, with analysis, IOCs, and detection signatures for an additional sample of 
BRICKSTORM. This sample is a different variant than the other samples. See Appendix D: Feb. 11, 
2026, Updates and Table 12. 
CISA, NSA, and Cyber Centre assess People’s Republic of China (PRC) state-sponsored cyber actors are 
using BRICKSTORM malware for long-term persistence on victim systems. Victim organizations are 
primarily in the Government Services and Facilities and Information Technology Sectors. BRICKSTORM is a 
sophisticated backdoor for VMware vSphere (specifically VMware vCenter servers,1 VMware ESXI,2 and 
VMware Aria Automation Orchestrator) and Windows environments.3  
These cyber actors have been observed targeting VMware vSphere platforms. Once compromised, the 
cyber actors can use their access to the vCenter management console to steal cloned virtual machine (VM) 
snapshots for credential extraction and create hidden, rogue VMs. See CISA’s Alert PRC State-Sponsored 
APT Actors Employ BRICKSTORM Malware Across Public Sector and Information Technology. 
CISA analyzed 12 BRICKSTORM samples obtained from victim organizations, including an organization 
where CISA conducted an incident response engagement. (CISA initially analyzed eight samples. The Dec. 
19, 2025, update includes analysis of three additional samples and the Feb. 11, 2026, update includes 
analysis of one sample.) 
At the victim organization where CISA conducted an incident response engagement, PRC state-sponsored 
cyber actors gained long-term persistent access to the organization’s internal network in April 2024 and 
uploaded BRICKSTORM malware to an internal VMware vCenter server. They also gained access to two 
domain controllers and an Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS) server. They successfully 
compromised the ADFS server and exported cryptographic keys. The cyber actors used BRICKSTORM for 
persistent access from at least April 2024 through at least Sep. 3, 2025. 
CISA, NSA, and Cyber Centre urge organizations to use the IOCs and detection signatures in this Malware 
Analysis Report to identify BRICKSTORM malware samples. If identified, follow the guidance in the Incident 
Response section.

Overview and Advisories webpage. 
Malware Summary 
BRICKSTORM is a custom Executable and Linkable Format (ELF) Go- or Rust-based backdoor (eight 
originally analyzed samples are Go-based, and two of the three new samples in the Dec. 19, 2025, update 
are Rust-based). The analyzed samples differ in function, but all enable cyber actors to maintain stealthy 
access and provide capabilities for initiation, persistence, and secure command and control (C2). Even 
though the analyzed samples were for VMware vSphere environments, there is reporting about Windows 
versions. 
BRICKSTORM initiates by running checks and maintains persistence by using a self-watching function and 
automatically reinstalls or restarts if disrupted. 
For C2, BRICKSTORM uses multiple layers of encryption (HTTPS, WebSockets, nested Transport Layer 
Security [TLS]) to hide its communications with the cyber actors’ C2 server. It also uses DNS-over-HTTPS 
(DoH) and mimics web server functionality to blend its communications with legitimate traffic. For remote 
system control, BRICKSTORM gives cyber actors interactive shell access on the system and allows them to 
browse, upload, download, create, delete, and manipulate files. In addition, some samples act as a SOCKS 
proxy, facilitating lateral movement and allowing cyber actors to compromise additional systems. 
Malware Delivery 
Note: This advisory uses the MITRE ATT&CK® Matrix for Enterprise framework, version 18. See Appendix A: 
MITRE ATT&CK Techniques for tables mapping the cyber actors’ activity to MITRE ATT&CK tactics and 
techniques. 
At the victim organization where CISA conducted an incident response engagement, PRC state-sponsored 
cyber actors accessed a web server on April 11, 2024. The web server was inside the organization’s 
demilitarized zone (DMZ), and cyber actors accessed it through a web shell [T1505.003] present on the 
server. Incident data does not indicate how they obtained initial access to the web server or when the web 
shell was implanted. On the same day, the cyber actors used service account credentials [T1078] to move 
laterally using Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) [T1021.001] from the web server to a domain controller in 
the DMZ, from which they copied the Active Directory (AD) database (ntds.dit) [T1003.003]. 
On April 12, 2024, the cyber actors moved laterally from the web server to a domain controller within the 
internal network using RDP and credentials associated with a second service account. It is unknown how 
they obtained the credentials. Subsequently, they copied the AD database, obtaining credentials for a 
managed service provider (MSP) account. Using the MSP credentials, the cyber actors proceeded to move 
from the internal domain controller to the VMware vCenter server.

From the web server, the actors also moved laterally using Server Message Block (SMB) to two jump 
servers and an ADFS server, from which they exfiltrated cryptographic keys. See Figure 1 for a diagram of 
the cyber actors’ movement. 
 
Figure 1. PRC State-Sponsored Cyber Actors’ Lateral Movement 
After gaining access to vCenter, the cyber actors elevated privileges using the sudo command 
[T1548.003], dropped BRICKSTORM malware in the server’s /etc/sysconfig/ directory [T1105], and 
modified the system’s init file in /etc/sysconfig/ to run BRICKSTORM. 
The modified init file controls the bootup process [T1037] on VMware vSphere systems and executes 
BRICKSTORM. Typically, this file is used to define certain visual variables for the bootup process. After the 
setting for visual variables, an additional line was added to the script to execute BRICKSTORM from the 
hard-coded file path /etc/sysconfig/. 
Note: CISA is still completing analysis to understand the malicious activity and full impact of the 
compromise.

Malware Functionality 
Note: This analysis is of Samples 1 through 8. See Appendix C: Dec. 19, 2025, Updates for functionality of 
Samples 9 through 11. 
All analyzed samples enable cyber actors to maintain stealthy access and provide capabilities for 
environment configuration (initiation), persistence, and secure C2. While initiation and persistence 
functions are similar across the samples, the secure C2 function varies. BRICKSTORM uses custom 
handlers to set up a SOCKS proxy, create a web server on the compromised system, and execute 
commands on the compromised system. 
Samples 7 and 8 were designed to work in virtualized environments, using a virtual socket (VSOCK) 
interface to enable inter-VM communication, facilitate data exfiltration, and maintain persistence. 
Most samples used Exclusive OR (XOR) cipher encryption to hide key strings, such as the Internet Protocol 
version 4 (IPv4) addresses of public DoH servers, within their code.

AR25-338A  
Page 11 of 48 TLP:CLEAR 
Initiation Capabilities 
Upon execution, BRICKSTORM runs checks and can reinstall and restart itself to maintain persistence. 
BRICKSTORM initiates a function (referred to as main_startNew in some samples) to configure 
environment variables specific to the compromised environment, enabling it to operate effectively. 
Following this, BRICKSTORM identifies if it is already in its intended state and proceeds to continue 
running, copy itself for execution, or terminate based on the following logic: 
1. Environment Variable Check: BRICKSTORM checks a specified environment variable (differs by 
sample; see Table 9) to determine if it is running as a child process (to identify if it is running in its 
intended state). 
a. If the specified variable is set, indicating it is running as a child process, BRICKSTORM 
continues its code execution. 
b. If the specified variable is not set (indicating it is not running as a child process), BRICKSTORM 
checks whether it is executing from /etc/sysconfig/ (Samples 1 through 2 and 4 through 7) 
or /etc/sysconfig/network/ (Sample 3) by attempting to load file contents from that path. 
2. File Path Validation and Copying: If BRICKSTORM is running from the validated path, it copies itself 
to a specific location with a specific file name. 
c. Next, the parent BRICKSTORM instance modifies the PATH environment variable by appending 
the copied location’s path [T1574.007]. This ensures the newly copied version of BRICKSTORM 
will be executed first if any commands or processes attempt to run VMware vSphere. 
d. The parent instance subsequently executes the copied instance of BRICKSTORM with the 
specified variable set in the context of the child process and terminates its own execution. 
3. Termination: If BRICKSTORM is not running from the validated path, it terminates its own 
execution. 
See Figure 2 for the operational flow of the malware.

Persistence Capabilities 
To ensure its continued operations, BRICKSTORM uses built-in self-monitoring and persistence capabilities 
while running. Specifically, it has a built-in self-watching function (referred to as main_selfWatcher in 
some samples) to maintain persistence. This function monitors if BRICKSTORM is running correctly and, if 
not, BRICKSTORM reinstalls and executes itself, mirroring its initiation capabilities. 
The self-watching function begins by checking a specific environment variable (see Table 10) to confirm 
whether BRICKSTORM is running as an active process. If the check returns a false value (indicating the 
variable is not set), BRICKSTORM assumes it is not running properly. In response, BRICKSTORM re-installs 
itself from predefined file path—/etc/sysconfig/ (Samples 1 through 2 and 4 through 8) or 
/etc/sysconfig/network/ (Sample 3)—to a new location (the file name of the new BRICKSTORM 
instance and location copied varies by sample; see Table 10). BRICKSTORM then updates the PATH 
environment variable to include the new file location, ensuring the newly copied backdoor file is executed 
first. Subsequently, the parent instance terminates its own execution, allowing the new process to take 
over. 
If the initial checks confirm that BRICKSTORM is running as intended (the variable is set), the self-watcher 
function allows the code to continue its operations.

Secure Command and Control 
After passing initiation checks, BRICKSTORM establishes a connection to a C2 server, secures 
communications with the server, and enables cyber actors’ full control over the compromised system. This 
control includes capabilities such as file system management and interactive shell access. In most 
samples, BRICKSTORM also provides a SOCKS proxy to facilitate tunneling and lateral movement. 
The implementation of these capabilities varies across samples, with notable differences in Samples 7 and 
8, which specifically target virtualized environments. 
Sample 1 
Initial Connection to the C2 Server: Sample 1 first creates an encrypted Domain Name System (DNS) query 
for a hard-coded C2 domain (the domain has been redacted from this report because according to public 
reporting, the cyber threat actors are not reusing C2 domains).4 The sample uses DoH to resolve the 
address of its C2 servers by sending an encrypted HTTPS request to one of the following legitimate public 
DoH resolvers [T1071.001]: 
▪ https[:]//1.0.0[.]1/dns-query (Cloudflare) 
▪ https[:]//1.1.1[.]1/dns-query (Cloudflare) 
▪ https[:]//8.8.4[.]4/dns-query (Google) 
▪ https[:]//8.8.8[.]8/dns-query (Google) 
▪ https[:]//9.9.9[.]9/dns-query (Quad9) 
If the C2 domain is not found in the public DoH resolver cache, the legitimate resolver forwards the request 
to the next server in the DNS hierarchy, ultimately reaching the threat actors’ DNS server. The DNS server 
responds with the correct IP address for the domain. The response is sent back through the legitimate DoH 
resolver to BRICKSTORM, which receives the encrypted response, decrypts it to get the C2 server’s IP 
address, and establishes a connection. 
Establishing Secure Communications: Sample 1 establishes an encrypted connection to the C2 server 
using HTTPS, then upgrades the session to WebSockets with an additional layer of TLS encryption. To do 
this, Sample 1 first communicates over HTTPS with a specific legitimate cloud platform (redacted). The 
sample then sends an HTTP upgrade request to convert the initial encrypted HTTPS connection into a 
persistent WebSocket connection: wss://[REDACTED].com/api. Sample 1 nests additional layers of TLS 
BRICKSTORM Backdoor TLP:CLEAR

AR25-338A  
Page 15 of 48 TLP:CLEAR 
encryption within the WebSocket session and performs a series of nested TLS handshakes within the 
established WebSocket tunnel. The first handshake is the standard TLS handshake for the initial HTTPS 
request to the cloud platform. The second TLS handshake occurs within the WebSocket tunnel, during 
which BRICKSTORM authenticates itself to the C2 server using a hard-coded key. 
Upon successful authentication, BRICKSTORM establishes a multiplexing layer, which allows it to send 
multiple commands and data streams over the same connection. It does this using both Simple 
Multiplexing (smux) and Yet Another Multiplexer (Yamux) libraries to create virtual streams over a single 
underlying TLS-secured connection based on client configuration or handshake data. Multiplexing conceals 
threat actor activity by embedding multiple commands and network tunnels within a single encrypted 
stream. 
See Figure 3 for the applicable decompiler output.

AR25-338A  
Page 16 of 48 TLP:CLEAR 
Full System Control: Once the secure connection to the C2 domain is established, Sample 1 uses a custom 
Go package wssoft2 to manage incoming network connections and to process commands it receives. 
Commands are directed to one of three handlers based on the function it needs: SOCKS Handler, Web 
Service Handler, and Command Handler. 
The SOCKS Handler sets up a SOCKS proxy [T1090.001] to route C2 traffic and facilitate lateral movement 
within the victim network. To set up the proxy, the handler parses JSON requests from the C2 server. If the 
request is valid, the handler delegates request handling to 
wssoft2/core/handler/socks.SocksWithLocalAddr, which performs SOCKS relaying and network 
tunneling over Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), User Datagram Protocol (UDP), and Internet Control 
Message Protocol (ICMP). 
See Figure 4 for the handler’s decompiler output. 
 
Figure 4. SOCKS Handler Decompiler Output 
The Web Service Handler establishes covert C2 communication by creating a legitimate-appearing web 
server on the compromised system. It uses the net/http package and gorilla/mux library to create 
the web server, which includes a hidden Application Programming Interface (API) endpoint for receiving and 
executing commands from the C2 server. See Figure 5 for the Web Service Handler decompiler output that 
sets up specific API endpoints.

Figure 5. Web Service Handler Decompiler Output Setting Up the Web Server With Specific API Endpoints 
Through the API, the cyber actors can browse, upload, download, create, delete, and manipulate files and 
folders on the victim’s system. See Table 11 for file management commands contained in BRICKSTORM.

file-md5 Calculates the MD5 checksum of a specified file to verify file integrity. 
get-file Downloads a file from the compromised system to the C2 server [T1041]. 
list-dir Lists the contents of a directory on the compromised system (e.g., browses the file system) 
[T1083]. 
put-file Uploads a file from the C2 server to the compromised system. 
slice-up Reads and downloads specific, partial sections of a file. 
To evade detection, BRICKSTORM serves seemingly legitimate web file types, such as Hypertext Markup 
Language (HTML), Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), and JavaScript, from a designated directory.

See Figure 6 for the Web Service Handler decompiler output.

The Command Handler executes shell commands on the compromised system, giving the cyber threat 
actors full control over the compromised system through interactive command-line access. The handler 
receives a JSON request from the C2 server, parses it, and extracts it. The handler then sets up a pseudo-
terminal (a virtual command-line interface) and runs the command on the victim system. 
See Figure 7 for the Command Handler decompiler output.

Samples 2 Through 6 
Initial Connection to the C2 Server: Like Sample 1, these samples create an encrypted DNS query for hard-
coded C2 domains (redacted) and use DoH to resolve the addresses of their C2 servers by sending an 
encrypted HTTPS request to one of the following legitimate public DoH resolvers: 
▪ https[:]//1.0.0[.]1/dns-query (Cloudflare) 
▪ https[:]//1.1.1[.]1/dns-query (Cloudflare) 
▪ https[:]//149.112.112[.]11/dns-query (Quad9) 
▪ https[:]//45.90.28.160/dns-query (NextDNS)

▪ https[:]//9.9.9[.]9/dns-query (Quad9) 
Note: Some of these samples use XOR encryption to decrypt IPv4 addresses for DoH servers. 
Establishing Secure Communications: Like Sample 1, these samples establish WebSocket Secure (WSS) 
connections with the C2 server and set up a multiplexing layer. 
Full System Control: Once the connection is established with the C2 server via WebSockets, these 
BRICKSTORM samples receive commands that are directed to one of four specific handlers to perform 
tasks on the compromised system: SOCKS Handler, Web Service Handler, Command Handler, or 
CommandNoContext Handler. The SOCKS, Web Service, and Command Handlers function similar to the 
Sample 1 handlers. The CommandNoContext Handler executes shell commands on the compromised 
system without using an explicit security context. 
Sample 7 
Initial Connection to the C2 Server: Sample 7 retrieves configuration parameters from environment 
variables, performs checks, generates a TLS configuration used for secure communication to 
BRICKSTORM’s client, and starts a network communications routine. This sample also uses a VSOCK 
interface to enable inter-VM communication, support data exfiltration, and maintain persistence in 
virtualized environments.  
Upon execution, Sample 7 retrieves the following three configuration values from environment variables 
using the os_Getenv function: 
▪ listenAddr (listen address and port) 
▪ listenPath (listen path to route requests to the WSS connection) 
▪ password (authentication key) 
Establishing Secure Communications: Sample 7 establishes a secure WebSocket server with minimal 
external dependencies; specifically, all communication is encrypted using in-memory self-signed 
certificates. This enables encrypted communication without relying on publicly trusted Certificate 
Authorities (CAs) or storing certificate files on disk. It dynamically generates a self-signed X.509 certificate 
and a corresponding 2048-bit Rivest–Shamir–Adleman (RSA) private key in memory, which are loaded into 
a tls.Certificate struct and assigned to the certificate field’s tls.Config object. This allows the 
server to handle HTTPS/WSS connections using the in-memory self-signed certificate, as standard 
NET/HTTP servers are configured to use tls.Config. 
Sample 7 uses a single, multiplexed connection over secure WebSockets to communicate with a specified 
C2 address (retrieved from the listenAddr value) and path (retrieved from the listenPath value). 
During or before the WSS handshake, Sample 7 implements a custom authentication check, involving the 
specific pre-shared authentication key (retrieved from password value). 
BRICKSTORM Backdoor TLP:CLEAR 
CISA | NSA | Cyber Centre 
AR25-338A  
Page 21 of 48 TLP:CLEAR 
Full System Control: Once the WSS connection with the C2 server is established, Sample 7 processes 
incoming commands through one of four handlers: Web Service Handler, Command Handler, VSOCK-proxy 
handler, or VSOCK handler. 
The Web Service Handler functions similar to Sample 1’s Web Service Handler. 
The Command Handler functions similar to Sample 1’s Command Handler. 
The VSOCK-proxy Handler performs VSOCK relaying and network tunneling. It implements a proxy with 
specific configuration arguments to establish a tunneled connection to process JSON payloads. First, the 
handler unmarshals the payload data and extracts and validates the TunnelAddr, Context ID (CID), 
Port, and Family configuration arguments. Based on the validated arguments, the handler binds to a 
specific VSOCK address (defined by the CID and port) and establishes a connection to the destination 
specified by TunnelAddr. When the connection is completed or terminated, the handler sends an 
appropriate success or error response back to the client. This functionality enables cyber actors to 
maintain covert communication channels, evade detection, and pivot within virtualized environments. 
The VSOCK Connection Handler creates and connects to VSOCK endpoints to maintain covert connections 
within the virtual environment. It processes incoming network requests containing a JSON payload with 
specific configuration arguments for connecting to a VSOCK endpoint. The handler extracts the JSON 
payload from the request and uses a JSON parser to unmarshal the data into a structured object with fields 
for Context (CID), Port, and Family. The handler checks the unmarshalled data for validity and, if the 
configuration is valid, the handler establishes a connection to a VSOCK endpoint using a specified CID and 
port number. If the virtual socket creation is successful, the handler allocates a new runtime object to hold 
the CID and port information. If unmarshalling fails, validation fails, or the destination connection cannot 
be established, the handler returns an appropriate error to the client. 
Sample 8 
Like Sample 7, Sample 8: 
▪ Retrieves C2 parameters (listenAddr, listenPath, and password) from environment variables, 
▪ Uses a self-signed X.509 certificate and a corresponding 2048-bit RSA private key in memory to 
facilitate encrypted communications without relying on a CA, 
▪ Establishes a secure WebSocket server for encrypted communication, and 
▪ Directs commands to specific handlers. 
Sample 8’s handlers directing commands differ from Sample 7. In addition to a Web Service Handler, 
Command Handler, VSOCK-proxy Handler, and VSOCK Connection Handler, Sample 8 also has two 
additional handlers: The SOCKS Handler (which functions similar to Sample 1’s SOCKS Handler) and the 
CommandNoContext Handler (which functions similar to Samples 2 through 6’s CommandNoContext 
Handler).

Sigma Rule 
Deploy the CISA-created Sigma rule in Table 13 to detect BRICKSTORM. 
Note: This rule can be run in an entity’s security information and event management (SIEM) system, but it 
will only be useful if the SIEM contains the vCenter logs. Additionally, this detection method will not work if 
run on endpoint detection and response (EDR) logs.

                             ## CISA Code & Media Analysis ## 
                            ############ README ############### 
## Edit rules and queries as needed for your hunt and based on your environment. 
## Ensure your EDR/SIEM instance has enough memory to run these AND/OR condition based queries. May 
take longer to run than conventional Sigma rule query.
