Successful exploitation of CVE-2025-11371 can allow remote, unauthenticated attackers to read sensitive system files, leading to information disclosure. When chained with CVE-2025-30406 (which affects the same products), attackers can conduct remote code execution (RCE) via ViewState deserialization. The unauthenticated LFI arises from the \/storage\/t.dn endpoint, which is handled by GladinetStorage.TempDownload in GSUploadDownloadProxy.dll . The handler is intended to return temporary files, but does not properly validate or normalize the user-controlled s path parameter and does not enforce authentication. Because the app typically runs as NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM , its temp root resolves under C:\\Windows\\Temp\\glad_temp .

Communication via HTTP HTTP is the most common protocol for building a Mythic agent control network. The HTTP transport container acts as a proxy between the agents and the Mythic server. It allows data to be transmitted in both plaintext and encrypted form. Crucially, the metadata is not encrypted, which enables the creation of signature-based detection rules. Below is an example of unencrypted Mythic network traffic over HTTP. During a GET request, data encoded in Base64 is passed in the value of the query parameter. After decoding, the agent s UUID generated according to a specific pattern becomes visible. This identifier is followed by a JSON object containing the key parameters of the host, collected by the agent. If data encryption is applied, the network traffic for agent communication appears as shown in the screenshot below.","label":[],"Comments":[],"labels":null}

The payload is encoded in Base64 and published in plaintext; therefore, anyone who can view the repository or analyze the traffic contents can decode it. Analysis of agent communication revealed that the most useful traffic for creating detection rules is associated with publishing check-in comments, creating a branch, and publishing a file. During the check-in phase, the agent posts a comment to register a new agent and establish communication. The transmitted data is encoded in Base64 and contains the agent s UUID and the portion of the message encrypted using AES-256.

Embedded Payloads While most globally defined strings in the analyzed sample are simply Base64-encoded, the embedded payloads use a combination of hexadecimal encoding and Base64. These payloads are embedded directly as encoded byte strings within the .rdata section of the binary. Figure 5: The encoded embedded payloads. Two of the encoded payloads are different vulnerable drivers used by the EDR\/AV killer logic. Only one of them is deployed on the infected system, depending on the detected Windows version. The older driver is a 64-bit, validly signed Advanced Malware Protection driver, ZAM.exe , version 3.0.0.000. This driver is already known to be vulnerable and is detected by both LOLDrivers and the Microsoft Vulnerable Driver Blocklist. It is used only if the infected system is running an older version of Windows (e.g., Windows 7). The newer driver is a 64-bit, validly signed WatchDog Antimalware driver, amsdk.sys , version 1.0.600.","label":[],"Comments":[],"labels":null}

Tactics and Techniques In this malware, the files are staged in C:\\ProgramData by the actor after gaining access to the system through other means. The files consist of four parts: A legitimate OneDrive.exe executable, the malicious SSPICLI.dll which is sideloaded by OneDrive, tmp7E9C.dll a renamed copy of the original sspicli.dll that is used by the malicious dll, and testtemp.ini which is the VBA Macro backdoor.

Consequently, creating a single, universal signature for detecting Mythic agents in network traffic is challenging; individual detection rules must be crafted for each protocol.

If any of these windows contain keywords related to targeted entities, the script looks for a TDA file dropped by the installer and decrypts and injects it into a hollowed \"svchost.exe\" process, following which the loader searches for an additional DMP file containing the banking trojan. \"If a TDA file is present, the AutoIt script decrypts and loads it as an intermediate PE loader (Stage 2) into memory,\" Trend Micro explained. \"However, if only a DMP file is found (no TDA present), the AutoIt script bypasses the intermediate loader entirely and loads the banking trojan directly into the AutoIt process memory, skipping the process hollowing step and running as a simpler two-stage infection.\" Persistence is achieved by constantly keeping tabs on the newly spawned \"svchost.exe\" process.","label":[],"Comments":[],"labels":[]}

Self modifying code: Pre-patch code. The next one is the post-patch, which is similar to the pre-patch and overwrites a mov rax,1234 with a mov rax,1 , but this modification is done after the code was executed. This means when the function is called the next time, the values in rax and rbx are not equal anymore, the comparison later fails, and the jump is not taken. Figure 21. Self modifying code: Post-patch code. Last but not least, in the middle of the function, we do the interleave trick. The test rax,rax will set ZF=0 (RAX = 3) which means the jz will not be taken and the jnz will be taken. Some static disassemblers get confused by this and disassemble the byte starting with 048h, 0C7h, to a mov rax, 0FFFFFFFF90900CEB , because they do not realize that these bytes are never executed.","label":[],"Comments":[],"labels":[]}
