Valid Accounts Crypto24 leveraged account manipulation to maintain privileged access. Attackers reactivated dormant default administrator accounts and created new accounts with generic names to avoid raising suspicion. Using net.exe , they modified and re-enabled accounts, then added them to the Administrators group for elevated privileges. net user /add net user administrator /active:yes net user net localgroup administrators /add net localgroup \"Remote Desktop Users\" /add This dual strategy of reusing ors group for elevated privileges. net user /add net user administrator /active:yes net user net localgroup administrators /add net localgroup \"Remote Desktop Users\" /add This dual strategy of reusing built-in accounts and introducing fresh ones ensured redundant privileged access, reduced detection likelihood, and enabled reliable persistence for lateral movement and ransomware deployment. Discovery The actor conducted reconnaissance through two distinct command executions. System Profiling via Batch Script #Process cmd.exe /c '\\ \\Scan\\1.bat' wmic partition get name,size, type enumerated disk partitions wmic computersystem get TotalPhysicalMemory,caption collected memory and OS details. This allowed the actor to build a profile of system hardware and storage configuration. Account and Privilege Enumeration # Process cmd.exe net user listed local accounts net localgroup identified group memberships. vilege Enumeration # Process cmd.exe net user listed local accounts net localgroup identified group memberships. This step provided visibility into existing access and privilege levels, helping the actor identify potential targets for lateral movement. By combining system and account reconnaissance, the attacker gained a comprehensive understanding of the host environment, enabling effective planning for subsequent attack stages. Persistence Crypto24 ransomware actors established persistence through scheduled tasks, malicious services, and privileged account creation, disguising activity within legitimate Windows processes to reduce detection. Scheduled Tasks # Process wscript.exe / cmd.exe %ProgramData%\\Update\\update.vbs executed at regular intervals %ProgramData%\\Update\\vm.bat executed at regular intervals These tasks ensured periodic execution of malicious payloads to maintain a foothold. Malicious Services # Process sc. t regular intervals These tasks ensured periodic execution of malicious payloads to maintain a foothold. Malicious Services # Process sc.exe (Service Control) Keylogger: sc create WinMainSvc type = share start= auto binPath= \"C:\\Windows\\System32\\scvhost.exe -k WinMainSvc\" Ransomware: sc create MSRuntime type = share start= auto binpath= \"C:\\Windows\\System32\\svchost.exe -k MSRuntime\" displayname= \"Microsoft Runtime Manager\" The attacker leveraged svchost.exe to masquerade as legitimate services, enabling stealth deployment of a keylogger and the Crypto24 ransomware. Account Creation # Process update.bat Crypto24 ransomware holders created a new user account and added it to Administrators and Remote Desktop Users groups. This granted elevated privileges and remote access, further strengthening persistence. Through recurring tasks, disguised services, and privileged accounts, the attacker ensured durable and covert access to compromised systems. ng persistence. Through recurring tasks, disguised services, and privileged accounts, the attacker ensured durable and covert access to compromised systems. Privilege Escalation The threat actor escalated privileges using a combination of batch scripts, runas.exe , and PsExec, granting administrative rights and enabling high-level system access. Administrator Group Modification # Process cmd.exe /c C:\\update.bat net.exe localgroup administrators john /add net.exe localgroup administrators service.lot9 /add net.exe localgroup administrators 00025436 /add net.exe localgroup \"administrators\" \"NetUser\" /add net.exe localgroup \"Remote Desktop Users\" \"NetUser\" /add net.exe localgroup administrators IT.Guest /add These commands added multiple accounts to the Administrators and Remote Desktop Users groups, granting them elevated privileges and remote access capabilities. Runas Execution # Process C:\\Windows\\explorer.exe runas. s groups, granting them elevated privileges and remote access capabilities. Runas Execution # Process C:\\Windows\\explorer.exe runas.exe /user:administrator cmd This opened a Command Prompt session with administrator-level privileges under the specified account. PsExec Execution # Process $mytemp $\\low\\psexec64.exe -u -p cmd PsExec was leveraged to launch a command prompt using privileged user credentials, enabling remote privilege escalation and administrative control. Through user group modification, impersonation with runas.exe , and remote execution with PsExec, the actor ensured persistent administrative access and expanded control over compromised systems. Defense Evasion To maintain access and avoid detection, the actor repeatedly created administrative accounts, initiated RDP sessions, and leveraged custom tools to weaken host defenses. A notable component was the deployment of a tool resembling RealBlindingEDR , observed across multiple endpoints, specifically designed to bypas ns, and leveraged custom tools to weaken host defenses. A notable component was the deployment of a tool resembling RealBlindingEDR , observed across multiple endpoints, specifically designed to bypass Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) mechanisms. Tool Deployment The following files were identified. %USERPROFILE%. \\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\Low\\ AVB.exe %USERPROFILE%. \\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\Low\\ AVMon.exe %PROGRAMDATA%\\update\\ avb.exe Command-Line Arguments The tool accepts a single argument to specify driver number and associated function. 1 Loads WdFilter.sys (Windows Defender Filter Driver) 2 Loads MpKslDrv.sys (Microsoft Malware Protection Kernel Service Library Driver) 3 Loads mpsdrv.sys (Microsoft Protection Service Driver) 4 Loads WdNisDrv.sys (Windows Defender Network Inspection Service Driver) This behavior directly targeted core Microsoft security drivers to impair defense capabilities. 4); if ( result ) break ; v4 = &SubStr[++v5]; if ( !v4 ) return result; } return ( char *) 1 ; By dynamically querying driver metadata and filtering against a vendor list, the tool selectively disabled protections from well-known security products. This allowed the attacker to maintain a persistent presence on compromised hosts while evading endpoint detection and incident response mechanisms. Lateral Movement: Remote Services Following initial compromise and account creation, the threat actor expanded their control using PsExec, registry modifications, and firewall rules to enable Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) access. They also deployed a network scanning utility to identify additional systems in the environment for lateral movement. PsExec Service Deployment # Process C:\\Windows\\ PSEXESVC.exe This binary is installed and executed by PsExec when initiating remote sessions. It allowed the attacker to run commands interactively on the compromised system under the context of privileged c C.exe This binary is installed and executed by PsExec when initiating remote sessions. It allowed the attacker to run commands interactively on the compromised system under the context of privileged credentials. By establishing PsExec service execution, the actor ensured reliable remote administration capabilities and a channel for pushing additional commands or payloads. Registry Modification to Enable RDP # Process C:\\Windows\\System32\\ cmd.exe # Command C:\\Windows\\System32\\ reg.exe ADD \"HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Terminal Server\" /v fDenyTSConnections /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f This command directly modified the registry key fDenyTSConnections , setting its value to 0 . By doing so, the attacker explicitly enabled RDP connections on the host, which are normally disabled in hardened environments. This change provided a persistent mechanism for graphical remote access, complementing the use of PsExec. Firewall Rule Addition # Process C:\\Windows\\System32\\ netsh. d in hardened environments. This change provided a persistent mechanism for graphical remote access, complementing the use of PsExec. Firewall Rule Addition # Process C:\\Windows\\System32\\ netsh.exe # Command advfirewall firewall add rule name= \"Open Remote Desktop\" protocol=TCP dir= in localport=3389 action=allow After enabling RDP in the registry, the attacker ensured accessibility by configuring Windows Firewall to allow inbound traffic on TCP port 3389. This effectively exposed the host to external RDP sessions, bypassing local network restrictions and strengthening their lateral movement strategy. Network Scanning Utility # Process C:\\Program Files\\Google\\Chrome\\Application\\ chrome.exe # Command $myuserprofile $\\downloads\\ipscan-3.9.1- setup.exe The actor installed Advanced IP Scanner (version 3.9.1) on one endpoint. This tool is widely used to enumerate active devices, open ports, and reachable services within a local network. (version 3.9.1) on one endpoint. This tool is\n",
