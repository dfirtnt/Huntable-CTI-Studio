# CTI Scraper Versioning System

CTI Scraper uses a combination of semantic versioning and moon crater names for major releases.

## Version Format

**Major.Minor.Patch "Crater Name"**

- **Major**: Significant architectural changes or breaking changes
- **Minor**: New features, backward compatible
- **Patch**: Bug fixes, backward compatible
- **Crater Name**: Named after prominent lunar craters

## Current Version

**v3.0.0 "Copernicus"** - Current stable release

## Moon Crater Naming System

Major versions are named after prominent lunar craters, honoring scientists, engineers, and explorers who have made significant contributions to their fields.

### Why Moon Craters?

- **Scientific Theme**: Fits the technical nature of the threat intelligence platform
- **Systematic**: Thousands of named craters available for future versions
- **Space Theme**: Represents exploration and discovery
- **No Scale Implication**: Doesn't suggest enterprise vs. small business
- **Unique**: Less common than ship names in software
- **Meaningful**: Each name has historical significance

### Named After

Moon craters are named by the International Astronomical Union (IAU) to honor:
- Scientists and mathematicians
- Engineers and inventors
- Explorers and astronomers
- Philosophers and thinkers

## Version History

### v3.0.0 "Copernicus" (2025-01-28)
- **Named After**: Nicolaus Copernicus, astronomer who revolutionized our understanding of the solar system
- **Significance**: Represents revolutionary changes and new paradigms
- **Features**: SIGMA rule similarity search, weighted hybrid embeddings, enhanced threat intelligence matching

### v2.0.0 "Tycho" (2025-01-15)
- **Named After**: Tycho Brahe, Danish astronomer known for accurate astronomical measurements
- **Significance**: One of the most prominent and visible craters on the moon
- **Features**: Major architectural rewrite with PostgreSQL, async support, Docker containerization

### Future Versions

**v4.0.0 "Kepler"** - Future major version
- **Named After**: Johannes Kepler, known for planetary motion laws
- **Significance**: Represents precision and mathematical understanding

## Version Naming Convention

### Major Versions (X.0.0)
- Named after prominent lunar craters
- Each name represents a significant milestone
- Names are chosen for their scientific significance

### Minor Versions (X.Y.0)
- Use military phonetic alphabet suffixes
- Example: v2.1.0 "Tycho-Alpha", v2.2.0 "Tycho-Bravo"

### Patch Versions (X.Y.Z)
- Numeric only
- Example: v2.1.1, v2.1.2

## Available Crater Names

With thousands of officially named lunar craters, there are plenty of options for future versions:

### Well-Known Craters
- **Tycho** - Most prominent crater (current)
- **Copernicus** - Revolutionary astronomer
- **Kepler** - Planetary motion laws
- **Aristarchus** - First heliocentrism proponent
- **Plato** - Philosopher
- **Archimedes** - Mathematician
- **Ptolemaeus** - Ancient astronomer
- **Alphonsus** - King Alfonso X
- **Clavius** - Jesuit mathematician
- **Theophilus** - Byzantine emperor

### Selection Criteria

When choosing crater names for major versions:
1. **Prominence**: Well-known and visible craters
2. **Scientific Significance**: Named after important figures
3. **Relevance**: Names that fit the platform's purpose
4. **Pronunciation**: Easy to say and remember
5. **Uniqueness**: Distinctive and memorable
