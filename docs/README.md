# Documentation Index

Docs now follow the MkDocs Material navigation defined in `mkdocs.yml`. Use `mkdocs serve` to preview locally; the site sources live entirely in `/docs`.

## Primary entry points
- `index.md` — overview of Huntable CTI Studio, services, and stack health checks
- `quickstart.md` — Docker-first end-to-end ingest → workflow → Sigma → pytest
- `concepts/` — huntables, agents, pipelines, observables
- `howto/` — run locally, add feeds, extract observables, generate Sigma, evaluate models
- `reference/` — configuration, API, schemas, Sigma prompt, versioning
- `internals/` — architecture diagrams, scoring, chunking, QA loops
- `contributing.md` — contributor workflow and expectations

## Legacy material
Historical docs remain under `docs/archive` and topic-specific folders (`features/`, `operations/`, `development/`). Keep them for reference but prefer the structure above as the source of truth.
