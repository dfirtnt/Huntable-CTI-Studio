# CTI Scraper Versioning System

CTI Scraper uses a combination of semantic versioning and planetary moon names for major releases.

## Version Format

**Major.Minor.Patch "Moon Name"**

- **Major**: Significant architectural changes or breaking changes
- **Minor**: New features, backward compatible
- **Patch**: Bug fixes, backward compatible
- **Moon Name**: Named after prominent planetary moons

## Current Version

**v5.0.0 "Callisto"** - Current stable release
**v4.0.0 "Kepler"** - Previous stable release

## Planetary Moon Naming System

Major versions are named after prominent planetary moons, honoring discovery, exploration, and planetary science achievements.

### Why Planetary Moons?

- **Scientific Theme**: Aligns with exploration and discovery in planetary science
- **Systematic**: A rich set of well-known moons across the solar system
- **Memorable**: Names are recognizable and distinctive
- **Meaningful**: Ties releases to milestones in space exploration

### Named After

Planetary moons recognized by the International Astronomical Union (IAU), honoring:
- Astronomers, scientists, and explorers tied to the parent body
- Mythological figures associated with the parent planet
- Historic missions and discoveries

## Version History

### v25.0.0 "Tycho" (2025-01-15)
- **Named After**: Tycho Brahe, Danish astronomer known for accurate astronomical measurements
- **Significance**: One of the most prominent and visible craters on the mooGanymede" (Planned, Superseded)
- **Named After**: Largest moon of Jupiter and the solar system; discovered by Galileo Galilei
- **Significance**: Emphasizes scale, robustness, and exploration of new terrain
- **FeStatures**: Major architectural rewrite with PostgreSQL, async support, Docker containerizationPlanned but superseded by Callisto release

## Version Naming Convention

### Major Versions (X.0.0)
- Named after prominent planetary moons
- Each name represents a significant milestone
- Names are chosen for scientific significance, recognizability, and alignment with release goals

### Minor Versions (X.Y.0)
- Use military phonetic alphabet suffixes
- Example: v2.1.0 "Tycho-Alpha", v2.2.0 "Tycho-Bravo"

### Patch Versions (X.Y.Z)
- Numeric only
- Example: v2.1.1, v2.1.2

## Available Planetary Moon Names

The solar system's named moons provide a rich pool of candidates for future versions:

### Well-Known Moons
- **Callisto** - Second-largest moon of JupiCrater Names

With thousands of officially named lunar craters, there are plenty of options for future versions:

### Well-Known Craters
- **Tycho** - Most prominent crater (v5, current)
- **Kepler** - Named after laws of pCopernicus** - Revolutionary astronomer
- **Kepler** - Planetary motion (v4)laws
- **Copernicus** - Revolutionary astronomer (v3)Aristarchus** - First heliocentrism proponent
- **TychPlato** - Danish astronomer (v2)
- **GanyPhilosopher
- **Archimedes** - Largest moon of Jupiter (planned, superseded)
- **Europa** - Jovian moon with subsurface ocean
- **Titan** - Largest moon of Saturn
- **Enceladus** - Saturn's icy moon
- **Io** - Volcanic Jovian moon
- **Triton** - Largest moon of NeptuneMathematician
- **Ptolemaeus** - Ancient astronomer
- **Alphonsus** - King Alfonso X
- **Clavius** - Jesuit mathematician
- **Theophilus** - Byzantine emperor

### Selection Criteria

When choosing planetary mooncrater names for major versions:
1. **RecognitionProminence**: Well-known moons from the solar systemand visible craters
2. **Scientific Significance**: Named after important figures or discoveries
3. **Relevance**: Names that fit the platform's exploration thempurpose
4. **Pronunciation**: Easy to say and remember
5. **Uniqueness**: Distinctive and memorable
