## Summary
Vulnerability Summary for the Week of September 22, 2025 rgeraldo Sep 29, 2025 High Vulnerabilities Primary Vendor -- Product Description Published CVSS Score Source Info Patch Info FlowiseAI--Flowise Flowise is a drag & drop user interface to build a customized large language model flow. In version 3.0.5, Flowise is vulnerable to remote code execution. The CustomMCP node allows users to input configuration settings for connecting to an external MCP server. This node parses the user-provided mcpServerConfig string to build the MCP server configuration. However, during this process, it executes JavaScript code without any security validation. Specifically, inside the convertToValidJSONString function, user input is directly passed to the Function() constructor, which evaluates and executes the input as JavaScript code. Since this runs with full Node.js runtime privileges, it can access dangerous modules such as child_process and fs. This issue has been patched in version 3.0.6. 2025-09-22 10 CVE-2025-59528 https://github.com/FlowiseAI/Flowise/security/advisories/GHSA-3gcm-f6qx-ff7p https://github.com/FlowiseAI/Flowise/blob/5930f1119c655bcf8d2200ae827a1f5b9fec81d0/packages/components/nodes/tools/MCP/CustomMCP/CustomMCP.ts#L132 https://github.com/FlowiseAI/Flowise/blob/5930f1119c655bcf8d2200ae827a1f5b9fec81d0/packages/components/nodes/tools/MCP/CustomMCP/CustomMCP.ts#L220 https://github.com/FlowiseAI/Flowise/blob/5930f1119c655bcf8d2200ae827a1f5b9fec81d0/packages/components/nodes/tools/MCP/CustomMCP/CustomMCP.ts#L262-L270 https://github.com/FlowiseAI/Flowise/blob/5930f1119c655bcf8d2200ae827a1f5b9fec81d0/packages/server/src/controllers/nodes/index.ts#L57-L78 https://github.com/FlowiseAI/Flowise/blob/5930f1119c655bcf8d2200ae827a1f5b9fec81d0/packages/server/src/routes/node-load-methods/index.ts#L5 https://github.com/FlowiseAI/Flowise/blob/5930f1119c655bcf8d2200ae827a1f5b9fec81d0/packages/server/src/services/nodes/index.ts#L91-L94 https://github.com/FlowiseAI/Flowise/releases/tag/flowise%403.0.6 HaruTheme--WooCommerce Designer Pro Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type vulnerability in HaruTheme WooCommerce Designer Pro allows Upload a Web Shell to a Web Server.

This issue has been patched via commit 041729c. 2025-09-25 9.8 CVE-2025-59834 https://github.com/srmorete/adb-mcp/security/advisories/GHSA-54j7-grvr-9xwg https://github.com/srmorete/adb-mcp/commit/041729c0b25432df3199ff71b3163a307cf4c28c https://github.com/srmorete/adb-mcp/blob/master/src/index.ts#L334-L355 FlagForgeCTF--flagForge Flag Forge is a Capture The Flag (CTF) platform. In versions from 2.2.0 to before 2.3.1, the FlagForge web application improperly handles session invalidation. Authenticated users can continue to access protected endpoints, such as /api/profile, even after logging out. CSRF tokens are also still valid post-logout, which can allow unauthorized actions. This issue has been patched in version 2.3.1. 2025-09-25 9.8 CVE-2025-59841 https://github.com/FlagForgeCTF/flagForge/security/advisories/GHSA-h6pr-4cwv-6cjg https://github.com/FlagForgeCTF/flagForge/commit/304b6c82a4f76871b336404b91e5cdd8a7d7d5bd formbricks--formbricks Formbricks is an open source qualtrics alternative. Prior to version 4.0.1, Formbricks is missing JWT signature verification. This vulnerability stems from a token validation routine that only decodes JWTs (jwt.decode) without verifying their signatures. Both the email verification token login path and the password reset server action use the same validator, which does not check the token's signature, expiration, issuer, or audience. If an attacker learns the victim's actual user.id, they can craft an arbitrary JWT with an alg: "none" header and use it to authenticate and reset the victim's password. This issue has been patched in version 4.0.1. 2025-09-26 9.4 CVE-2025-59934 https://github.com/formbricks/formbricks/security/advisories/GHSA-7229-q9pv-j6p4 https://github.com/formbricks/formbricks/pull/6596 https://github.com/formbricks/formbricks/commit/eb1349f205189d5b2d4a95ec42245ca98cf68c82 https://github.com/formbricks/formbricks/blob/843110b0d6c37b5c0da54291616f84c91c55c4fc/apps/web/lib/jwt.ts#L114-L117 webandprint--AR For WordPress Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in webandprint AR For WordPress allows Upload a Web Shell to a Web Server.

This vulnerability is due to improper handling of crafted Ethernet frames. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted Ethernet frames through an affected switch. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the egress port to which the crafted frame is forwarded to start dropping all frames, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. 2025-09-24 7.4 CVE-2025-20311 cisco-sa-cat9k-PtmD7bgy Cisco--Cisco IOS XE Software A vulnerability in the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) subsystem of Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to improper error handling when parsing a specific SNMP request. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a specific SNMP request to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to reload unexpectedly, resulting in a DoS condition. This vulnerability affects SNMP versions 1, 2c, and 3. To exploit this vulnerability through SNMPv2c or earlier, the attacker must know a valid read-write or read-only SNMP community string for the affected system. To exploit this vulnerability through SNMPv3, the attacker must have valid SNMP user credentials for the affected system. 2025-09-24 7.7 CVE-2025-20312 cisco-sa-snmpwred-x3MJyf5M Cisco--IOS A vulnerability in the web UI of Cisco IOS Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker with low privileges to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to improper input validation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted URL in an HTTP request. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition. 2025-09-24 7.7 CVE-2025-20327 cisco-sa-ios-invalid-url-dos-Nvxszf6u Cisco--IOS A vulnerability in the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) subsystem of Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software could allow the following: An authenticated, remote attacker with low privileges could cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device that is running Cisco IOS Software or Cisco IOS XE Software. To cause the DoS, the attacker must have the SNMPv2c or earlier read-only community string or valid SNMPv3 user credentials. An authenticated, remote attacker with high privileges could execute code as the root user on an affected device that is running Cisco IOS XE Software. To execute code as the root user, the attacker must have the SNMPv1 or v2c read-only community string or valid SNMPv3 user credentials and administrative or privilege 15 credentials on the affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted SNMP packet to an affected device over IPv4 or IPv6 networks. This vulnerability is due to a stack overflow condition in the SNMP subsystem of the affected software. A successful exploit could allow a low-privileged attacker to cause the affected system to reload, resulting in a DoS condition, or allow a high-privileged attacker to execute arbitrary code as the root user and obtain full control of the affected system. Note: This vulnerability affects all versions of SNMP. 2025-09-24 7.7 CVE-2025-20352 cisco-sa-snmp-x4LPhte Qualcomm, Inc.--Snapdragon Memory corruption when passing parameters to the Trusted Virtual Machine during the handshake. 2025-09-24 7.8 CVE-2025-21476 https://docs.qualcomm.com/product/publicresources/securitybulletin/september-2025-bulletin.html Qualcomm, Inc.--Snapdragon Memory corruption while performing private key encryption in trusted application. 2025-09-24 7.8 CVE-2025-21481 https://docs.qualcomm.com/product/publicresources/securitybulletin/september-2025-bulletin.html Qualcomm, Inc.--Snapdragon Cryptographic issue while performing RSA PKCS padding decoding. 2025-09-24 7.1 CVE-2025-21482 https://docs.qualcomm.com/product/publicresources/securitybulletin/september-2025-bulletin.html NVIDIA--Megatron-LM NVIDIA Megatron-LM for all platforms contains a vulnerability in the pretrain_gpt script, where malicious data created by an attacker may cause a code injection issue.

Prior to version 6.5.11, there is an absence of automatic session expiration following a user's password change. This oversight poses a security risk, as if a user forgets to log out from a location where they accessed their account, an unauthorized user can maintain access even after the password has been changed. Due to this bug, if an account has already been compromised, the legitimate user has no way to revoke the attacker's access. The malicious actor retains full access to the account until their session naturally expires. This means the account remains insecure even after the password has been changed. This issue has been patched in version 6.5.11. 2025-09-22 7.1 CVE-2025-59335 https://github.com/cubecart/v6/security/advisories/GHSA-4vwh-x8m2-fmvv https://github.com/cubecart/v6/commit/4bfaeb4485dd82255a108940a163af5ba4583b52 https://github.com/cubecart/v6/commit/62d9be8416aa6fd7343f8932d98c5b112b163e26 authlib--authlib Authlib is a Python library which builds OAuth and OpenID Connect servers. Prior to version 1.6.4, Authlib's JWS verification accepts tokens that declare unknown critical header parameters (crit), violating RFC 7515 "must understand" semantics. An attacker can craft a signed token with a critical header (for example, bork or cnf) that strict verifiers reject but Authlib accepts. In mixed language fleets, this enables split brain verification and can lead to policy bypass, replay, or privilege escalation.

A single cryptographic key is used across all tenants to sign authentication cookies, allowing a privileged user in one tenant to forge authentication cookies for users in other tenants. Because the Auto-Login feature is enabled by default, this flaw may allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access and potentially take over accounts in other tenants. Successful exploitation requires access to Adaptive Authentication functionality, which is typically restricted to high-privileged users. The vulnerability is only exploitable when Auto-Login is enabled, reducing its practical impact in deployments where the feature is disabled. 2025-09-23 6.8 CVE-2025-0663 https://security.docs.wso2.com/en/latest/security-announcements/security-advisories/2025/WSO2-2025-3864/ douglaskarr--TweetThis Shortcode The TweetThis Shortcode plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's 'tweetthis' shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 1.8.0 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes.

Prior to version 6.5.11, the contact form's Enquiry field accepts raw HTML and that HTML is included verbatim in the email sent to the store admin. By submitting HTML in the Enquiry, the admin receives an email containing that HTML. This indicates user input is not being escaped or sanitized before being output in email (and possibly when re-rendering the form), leading to Cross-Site Scripting / HTML injection risk in email clients or admin UI.

Prior to version 6.5.11, a vulnerability exists in the product reviews feature where user-supplied input is not properly sanitized before being displayed. An attacker can submit HTML tags inside the review description field. Once the administrator approves the review, the injected HTML is rendered on the product page for all visitors. This could be used to redirect users to malicious websites or to display unwanted content.

Prior to version 2.0.0, @conventional-changelog/git-client has an argument injection vulnerability. This vulnerability manifests with the library's getTags() API, which allows extra parameters to be passed to the git log command. In another API by this library, getRawCommits(), there are secure practices taken to ensure that the extra parameter path is unable to inject an argument by ending the git log command with the special shell syntax --. However, the library does not follow the same practice for getTags() as it does not attempt to sanitize for user input, validate the given params, or restrict them to an allow list. Nor does it properly pass command-line flags to the git binary using the double-dash POSIX characters (--) to communicate the end of options. Thus, allowing users to exploit an argument injection vulnerability in Git due to the --output= command-line option that results with overwriting arbitrary files.

Prior to version 1.130.1, the project's OIDC redirect handling logic constructs the host and protocol of the final redirect URL based on the X-Forwarded-Host or Host headers and the X-Forwarded-Proto value. In deployments where a reverse proxy forwards client-supplied X-Forwarded-* headers to the origin as-is, or where the origin trusts them without validation, an attacker can inject an arbitrary host and trigger an open redirect that sends users to a malicious domain.

Because the proxy forwards requests and headers, an attacker can reach internal-only endpoints and link-local metadata services, retrieve instance role credentials or other sensitive metadata, and interact with internal APIs and services that are not intended to be internet-facing. The vulnerability is exploitable by sending crafted requests to the proxy with the target resource encoded in the URL; many cors-anywhere deployments forward arbitrary methods and headers (including PUT), which can permit exploitation of IMDSv2 workflows as well as access to internal management APIs. Successful exploitation can result in theft of cloud credentials, unauthorized access to internal services, remote code execution or privilege escalation (depending on reachable backends), data exfiltration, and full compromise of cloud resources. Mitigation includes: restricting the proxy to trusted origins or authentication, whitelisting allowed target hosts, preventing access to link-local and internal IP ranges, removing support for unsafe HTTP methods/headers, enabling cloud provider mitigations, and deploying network-level protections. 2025-09-25 not yet calculated CVE-2020-36851 https://github.com/Rob--W/cors-anywhere/issues/152 https://github.com/Rob--W/cors-anywhere/issues/78 https://www.certik.com/resources/blog/cors-anywhere-dangers-of-misconfigured-third-party-software https://www.vulncheck.com/advisories/rob-w-cors-anywhere-misconfigured-cors-proxy-allows-ssrf https://github.com/SocketDev/security-research/security/advisories/GHSA-9wmg-93pw-fc3g https://github.com/Rob--W/cors-anywhere/issues/521 Linux--Linux In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: Bluetooth: hci_core: Disable works on hci_unregister_dev This make use of disable_work_* on hci_unregister_dev since the hci_dev is about to be freed new submissions are not disarable. 2025-09-24 not yet calculated CVE-2024-58241 https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/cfdb13a54e05eb98d9940cb6d1a13e7f994d811f https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/989fa5171f005ecf63440057218d8aeb1795287d Invoice Ninja--Invoice Ninja 5 Incorrect handling of uploaded files in the admin "Restore" function in Invoice Ninja <= 5.11.72 allows attackers with admin credentials to execute arbitrary code on the server via uploaded .php files. 2025-09-22 not yet calculated CVE-2025-10009 https://github.com/invoiceninja/invoiceninja/commit/02151b570b226b4584a8e61b06b10be9366da3de OnePlus--OxygenOS The vulnerability allows any application installed on the device to read SMS/MMS data and metadata from the system-provided Telephony provider without permission, user interaction, or consent.

In addition, since ECI restricts mounting the Docker socket into containers by default, it only affects containers which are explicitly allowed by the administrator to mount the Docker socket. 2025-09-26 not yet calculated CVE-2025-10657 https://docs.docker.com/desktop/release-notes Dingtian--DT-R002 All versions of Dingtian DT-R002 are vulnerable to an Insufficiently Protected Credentials vulnerability that could allow an attacker to retrieve the current user's username without authentication. 2025-09-25 not yet calculated CVE-2025-10879 https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-25-268-01 Dingtian--DT-R002 All versions of Dingtian DT-R002 are vulnerable to an Insufficiently Protected Credentials vulnerability that could allow an attacker to extract the proprietary "Dingtian Binary" protocol password by sending an unauthenticated GET request. 2025-09-25 not yet calculated CVE-2025-10880 https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-25-268-01 Google--Chrome Side-channel information leakage in V8 in Google Chrome prior to 140.0.7339.207 allowed a remote attacker to leak cross-origin data via a crafted HTML page.

The code declared queue_priority_map as s8 (*)[2] (pointer to array of 2 s8), but allocated memory using sizeof(s8) instead of the correct size. This caused out-of-bounds memory writes when accessing: queue_priority_map[i][0] = i; queue_priority_map[i][1] = i; The bug manifested as kernel crashes with "Oops - undefined instruction" on ARM platforms (BeagleBoard-X15) during EDMA driver probe, as the memory corruption triggered kernel hardening features on Clang. Change the allocation to use sizeof(*queue_priority_map) which automatically gets the correct size for the 2D array structure. 2025-09-23 not yet calculated CVE-2025-39869 https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/5e462fa0dfdb52b3983cf41532d3d4c7d63e2f93 https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/1baed10553fc8b388351d8fc803e3ae6f1a863bc https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/069fd1688c57c0cc8a3de64d108579b31676f74b https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/d5e82f3f2c918d446df46e8d65f8083fd97cdec5 https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/e63419dbf2ceb083c1651852209c7f048089ac0f Linux--Linux In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: dmaengine: idxd: Fix double free in idxd_setup_wqs() The clean up in idxd_setup_wqs() has had a couple bugs because the error handling is a bit subtle. It's simpler to just re-write it in a cleaner way. The issues here are: 1) If "idxd->max_wqs" is <= 0 then we call put_device(conf_dev) when "conf_dev" hasn't been initialized. 2) If kzalloc_node() fails then again "conf_dev" is invalid. It's either uninitialized or it points to the "conf_dev" from the previous iteration so it leads to a double free. It's better to free partial loop iterations within the loop and then the unwinding at the end can handle whole loop iterations. I also renamed the labels to describe what the goto does and not where the goto was located. 2025-09-23 not yet calculated CVE-2025-39870 https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/25e6146c2812487a88f619d5ff6efbdcd5b2bc31 https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/df82c7901513fd0fc738052a8e6a330d92cc8ec9 https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/ec5430d090d0b6ace8fefa290fc37e88930017d2 https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/9f0e225635475b2285b966271d5e82cba74295b1 https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/39aaa337449e71a41d4813be0226a722827ba606 Linux--Linux In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: dmaengine: idxd: Remove improper idxd_free The call to idxd_free() introduces a duplicate put_device() leading to a reference count underflow: refcount_t: underflow; use-after-free.

However, xilinx_can xcan_write_frame() keeps using SKB after the call. Fix that by only calling can_put_echo_skb() after the code is done touching the SKB. The tx_lock is held for the entire xcan_write_frame() execution and also on the can_get_echo_skb() side so the order of operations does not matter. An earlier fix commit 3d3c817c3a40 ("can: xilinx_can: Fix usage of skb memory") did not move the can_put_echo_skb() call far enough.

This occurs because there is no associated q_vector for the test ring when it is set up, as interrupts are typically not added to the test rings. Since commit 5ef44b3cb43b removed the napi_id assignment in __xdp_rxq_info_reg(), there is no longer a need to pass a napi_id to it.

This new function is supposed to return an error code which is checked by the caller (now ceph_process_folio_batch()), and on error, the caller invokes redirty_page_for_writepage() and then breaks from the loop. However, the refactoring commit has gone wrong, and it by accident, it always returns 0 (= success) because it first NULLs the pointer and then returns PTR_ERR(NULL) which is always 0. This means errors are silently ignored, leaving NULL entries in the page array, which may later crash the kernel. The simple solution is to call PTR_ERR() before clearing the pointer. 2025-09-23 not yet calculated CVE-2025-39878 https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/dd1616ecbea920d228c56729461ed223cc501425 https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/249e0a47cdb46bb9eae65511c569044bd8698d7d Linux--Linux In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: ceph: always call ceph_shift_unused_folios_left() The function ceph_process_folio_batch() sets folio_batch entries to NULL, which is an illegal state. Before folio_batch_release() crashes due to this API violation, the function ceph_shift_unused_folios_left() is supposed to remove those NULLs from the array. However, since commit ce80b76dd327 ("ceph: introduce ceph_process_folio_batch() method"), this shifting doesn't happen anymore because the "for" loop got moved to ceph_process_folio_batch(), and now the `i` variable that remains in ceph_writepages_start() doesn't get incremented anymore, making the shifting effectively unreachable much of the time. Later, commit 1551ec61dc55 ("ceph: introduce ceph_submit_write() method") added more preconditions for doing the shift, replacing the `i` check (with something that is still just as broken): - if ceph_process_folio_batch() fails, shifting never happens - if ceph_move_dirty_page_in_page_array() was never called (because ceph_process_folio_batch() has returned early for some of various reasons), shifting never happens - if `processed_in_fbatch` is zero (because ceph_process_folio_batch() has returned early for some of the reasons mentioned above or because ceph_move_dirty_page_in_page_array() has failed), shifting never happens Since those two commits, any problem in ceph_process_folio_batch() could crash the kernel, e.g. this way: BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000034 #PF: supervisor write access in kernel mode #PF: error_code(0x0002) - not-present page PGD 0 P4D 0 Oops: Oops: 0002 [#1] SMP NOPTI CPU: 172 UID: 0 PID: 2342707 Comm: kworker/u778:8 Not tainted 6.15.10-cm4all1-es #714 NONE Hardware name: Dell Inc.

(Interestingly, the crash happens only if `huge_zero_folio` has already been allocated; without `huge_zero_folio`, is_huge_zero_folio(NULL) returns true and folios_put_refs() skips NULL entries instead of dereferencing them. That makes reproducing the bug somewhat unreliable. See https://lore.kernel.org/20250826231626.218675-1-max.kellermann@ionos.com for a discussion of this detail.) My suggestion is to move the ceph_shift_unused_folios_left() to right after ceph_process_folio_batch() to ensure it always gets called to fix up the illegal folio_batch state. 2025-09-23 not yet calculated CVE-2025-39879 https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/289b6615cf553d98509a9b273195d9936da1cfb2 https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/cce7c15faaac79b532a07ed6ab8332280ad83762 Linux--Linux In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: libceph: fix invalid accesses to ceph_connection_v1_info There is a place where generic code in messenger.c is reading and another place where it is writing to con->v1 union member without checking that the union member is active (i.e. msgr1 is in use). On 64-bit systems, con->v1.auth_retry overlaps with con->v2.out_iter, so such a read is almost guaranteed to return a bogus value instead of 0 when msgr2 is in use. This ends up being fairly benign because the side effect is just the invalidation of the authorizer and successive fetching of new tickets. con->v1.connect_seq overlaps with con->v2.conn_bufs and the fact that it's being written to can cause more serious consequences, but luckily it's not something that happens often. 2025-09-23 not yet calculated CVE-2025-39880 https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/591ea9c30737663a471b2bb07b27ddde86b020d5 https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/23538cfbeed87159a5ac6c61e7a6de3d8d4486a8 https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/35dbbc3dbf8bccb2d77c68444f42c1e6d2d27983 https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/6bd8b56899be0b514945f639a89ccafb8f8dfaef https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/cdbc9836c7afadad68f374791738f118263c5371 Linux--Linux In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: kernfs: Fix UAF in polling when open file is released A use-after-free (UAF) vulnerability was identified in the PSI (Pressure Stall Information) monitoring mechanism: BUG: KASAN: slab-use-after-free in psi_trigger_poll+0x3c/0x140 Read of size 8 at addr ffff3de3d50bd308 by task systemd/1 psi_trigger_poll+0x3c/0x140 cgroup_pressure_poll+0x70/0xa0 cgroup_file_poll+0x8c/0x100 kernfs_fop_poll+0x11c/0x1c0 ep_item_poll.isra.0+0x188/0x2c0 Allocated by task 1: cgroup_file_open+0x88/0x388 kernfs_fop_open+0x73c/0xaf0 do_dentry_open+0x5fc/0x1200 vfs_open+0xa0/0x3f0 do_open+0x7e8/0xd08 path_openat+0x2fc/0x6b0 do_filp_open+0x174/0x368 Freed by task 8462: cgroup_file_release+0x130/0x1f8 kernfs_drain_open_files+0x17c/0x440 kernfs_drain+0x2dc/0x360 kernfs_show+0x1b8/0x288 cgroup_file_show+0x150/0x268 cgroup_pressure_write+0x1dc/0x340 cgroup_file_write+0x274/0x548 Reproduction Steps: 1.

And ZONE_DEVICE pages are never expected, so we can simply fail if pfn_to_online_page() == NULL to fix the bug. 2025-09-23 not yet calculated CVE-2025-39883 https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/e4ec6def5643a1c9511115b3884eb879572294c6 https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/3d278e89c2ea62b1aaa4b0d8a9766a35b3a3164a https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/7618fd443aa4cfa553a64cacf5721581653ee7b0 https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/63a327a2375a8ce7a47dec5aaa4d8a9ae0a00b96 https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/d613f53c83ec47089c4e25859d5e8e0359f6f8da Linux--Linux In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: btrfs: fix subvolume deletion lockup caused by inodes xarray race There is a race condition between inode eviction and inode caching that can cause a live struct btrfs_inode to be missing from the root->inodes xarray. Specifically, there is a window during evict() between the inode being unhashed and deleted from the xarray. If btrfs_iget() is called for the same inode in that window, it will be recreated and inserted into the xarray, but then eviction will delete the new entry, leaving nothing in the xarray: Thread 1 Thread 2 --------------------------------------------------------------- evict() remove_inode_hash() btrfs_iget_path() btrfs_iget_locked() btrfs_read_locked_inode() btrfs_add_inode_to_root() destroy_inode() btrfs_destroy_inode() btrfs_del_inode_from_root() __xa_erase In turn, this can cause issues for subvolume deletion. Specifically, if an inode is in this lost state, and all other inodes are evicted, then btrfs_del_inode_from_root() will call btrfs_add_dead_root() prematurely. If the lost inode has a delayed_node attached to it, then when btrfs_clean_one_deleted_snapshot() calls btrfs_kill_all_delayed_nodes(), it will loop forever because the delayed_nodes xarray will never become empty (unless memory pressure forces the inode out). We saw this manifest as soft lockups in production. Fix it by only deleting the xarray entry if it matches the given inode (using __xa_cmpxchg()). 2025-09-23 not yet calculated CVE-2025-39884 https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/9ba898c9fcbe6ebb88bcd4df8aab0f90090d202e https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/f1498abaf74f8d7b1e7001f16ed77818d8ae6a59 https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/f6a6c280059c4ddc23e12e3de1b01098e240036f Linux--Linux In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: ocfs2: fix recursive semaphore deadlock in fiemap call syzbot detected a OCFS2 hang due to a recursive semaphore on a FS_IOC_FIEMAP of the extent list on a specially crafted mmap file. context_switch kernel/sched/core.c:5357 [inline] __schedule+0x1798/0x4cc0 kernel/sched/core.c:6961 __schedule_loop kernel/sched/core.c:7043 [inline] schedule+0x165/0x360 kernel/sched/core.c:7058 schedule_preempt_disabled+0x13/0x30 kernel/sched/core.c:7115 rwsem_down_write_slowpath+0x872/0xfe0 kernel/locking/rwsem.c:1185 __down_write_common kernel/locking/rwsem.c:1317 [inline] __down_write kernel/locking/rwsem.c:1326 [inline] down_write+0x1ab/0x1f0 kernel/locking/rwsem.c:1591 ocfs2_page_mkwrite+0x2ff/0xc40 fs/ocfs2/mmap.c:142 do_page_mkwrite+0x14d/0x310 mm/memory.c:3361 wp_page_shared mm/memory.c:3762 [inline] do_wp_page+0x268d/0x5800 mm/memory.c:3981 handle_pte_fault mm/memory.c:6068 [inline] __handle_mm_fault+0x1033/0x5440 mm/memory.c:6195 handle_mm_fault+0x40a/0x8e0 mm/memory.c:6364 do_user_addr_fault+0x764/0x1390 arch/x86/mm/fault.c:1387 handle_page_fault arch/x86/mm/fault.c:1476 [inline] exc_page_fault+0x76/0xf0 arch/x86/mm/fault.c:1532 asm_exc_page_fault+0x26/0x30 arch/x86/include/asm/idtentry.h:623 RIP: 0010:copy_user_generic arch/x86/include/asm/uaccess_64.h:126 [inline] RIP: 0010:raw_copy_to_user arch/x86/include/asm/uaccess_64.h:147 [inline] RIP: 0010:_inline_copy_to_user include/linux/uaccess.h:197 [inline] RIP: 0010:_copy_to_user+0x85/0xb0 lib/usercopy.c:26 Code: e8 00 bc f7 fc 4d 39 fc 72 3d 4d 39 ec 77 38 e8 91 b9 f7 fc 4c 89 f7 89 de e8 47 25 5b fd 0f 01 cb 4c 89 ff 48 89 d9 4c 89 f6 <f3> a4 0f 1f 00 48 89 cb 0f 01 ca 48 89 d8 5b 41 5c 41 5d 41 5e 41 RSP: 0018:ffffc9000403f950 EFLAGS: 00050256 RAX: ffffffff84c7f101 RBX: 0000000000000038 RCX: 0000000000000038 RDX: 0000000000000000 RSI: ffffc9000403f9e0 RDI: 0000200000000060 RBP: ffffc9000403fa90 R08: ffffc9000403fa17 R09: 1ffff92000807f42 R10: dffffc0000000000 R11: fffff52000807f43 R12: 0000200000000098 R13: 00007ffffffff000 R14: ffffc9000403f9e0 R15: 0000200000000060 copy_to_user include/linux/uaccess.h:225 [inline] fiemap_fill_next_extent+0x1c0/0x390 fs/ioctl.c:145 ocfs2_fiemap+0x888/0xc90 fs/ocfs2/extent_map.c:806 ioctl_fiemap fs/ioctl.c:220 [inline] do_vfs_ioctl+0x1173/0x1430 fs/ioctl.c:532 __do_sys_ioctl fs/ioctl.c:596 [inline] __se_sys_ioctl+0x82/0x170 fs/ioctl.c:584 do_syscall_x64 arch/x86/entry/syscall_64.c:63 [inline] do_syscall_64+0xfa/0x3b0 arch/x86/entry/syscall_64.c:94 entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x77/0x7f RIP: 0033:0x7f5f13850fd9 RSP: 002b:00007ffe3b3518b8 EFLAGS: 00000246 ORIG_RAX: 0000000000000010 RAX: ffffffffffffffda RBX: 0000200000000000 RCX: 00007f5f13850fd9 RDX: 0000200000000040 RSI: 00000000c020660b RDI: 0000000000000004 RBP: 6165627472616568 R08: 0000000000000000 R09: 0000000000000000 R10: 0000000000000000 R11: 0000000000000246 R12: 00007ffe3b3518f0 R13: 00007ffe3b351b18 R14: 431bde82d7b634db R15: 00007f5f1389a03b ocfs2_fiemap() takes a read lock of the ip_alloc_sem semaphore (since v2.6.22-527-g7307de80510a) and calls fiemap_fill_next_extent() to read the extent list of this running mmap executable. The user supplied buffer to hold the fiemap information page faults calling ocfs2_page_mkwrite() which will take a write lock (since v2.6.27-38-g00dc417fa3e7) of the same semaphore. This recursive semaphore will hold filesystem locks and causes a hang of the fileystem. The ip_alloc_sem protects the inode extent list and size. Release the read semphore before calling fiemap_fill_next_extent() in ocfs2_fiemap() and ocfs2_fiemap_inline(). This does an unnecessary semaphore lock/unlock on the last extent but simplifies the error path. 2025-09-23 not yet calculated CVE-2025-39885 https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/36054554772f95d090eb45793faf6aa3c0254b02 https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/0709bc11b942870fc0a7be150e42aea42321093a https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/1d3c96547ee2ddeaddf8f19a3ef99ea06cc8115e https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/9efcb7a8b97310efed995397941a292cf89fa94f https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/04100f775c2ea501927f508f17ad824ad1f23c8d Linux--Linux In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: bpf: Tell memcg to use allow_spinning=false path in bpf_timer_init() Currently, calling bpf_map_kmalloc_node() from __bpf_async_init() can cause various locking issues; see the following stack trace (edited for style) as one example: ...

The above was reproduced on bpf-next (b338cf849ec8) by modifying ./tools/sched_ext/scx_flatcg.bpf.c to call bpf_timer_init() during ops.runnable(), and hacking the memcg accounting code a bit to make a bpf_timer_init() call more likely to raise an MEMCG_MAX event. We have also run into other similar variants (both internally and on bpf-next), including double-acquiring cgroup_file_kn_lock, the same worker_pool::lock, etc. As suggested by Shakeel, fix this by using __GFP_HIGH instead of GFP_ATOMIC in __bpf_async_init(), so that e.g. if try_charge_memcg() raises an MEMCG_MAX event, we call __memcg_memory_event() with @allow_spinning=false and avoid calling cgroup_file_notify() there.

The intent was to restrict access to sensitive connection fields to Connection Editing Users, effectively applying a "write-only" model for sensitive values. In Airflow 3.0.3, this model was unintentionally violated: sensitive connection information could be viewed by users with READ permissions through both the API and the UI. This behavior also bypassed the `AIRFLOW__CORE__HIDE_SENSITIVE_VAR_CONN_FIELDS` configuration option. This issue does not affect Airflow 2.x, where exposing sensitive information to connection editors was the intended and documented behavior.

When an administrator initiates "Open Remote Terminal" from the AiKaan dashboard, the controller sends this same static private key to the target device. The device then uses it to establish a reverse SSH tunnel to a remote access server, enabling browser-based SSH access for the administrator. Because the same `proxyuser` account and SSH key are reused across all customer environments: - An attacker who obtains the key (e.g., by intercepting it in transit, extracting it from the remote access server, or from a compromised admin account) can impersonate any managed device. - They can establish unauthorized reverse SSH tunnels and interact with devices without the owner's consent.

Since Arrays.equals performs a short-circuit comparison, the execution time varies depending on how many leading bytes match. This behavior could allow an attacker to perform a timing side-channel attack and potentially infer sensitive authentication material. All users relying on SCRAM authentication are impacted.

Prior to Claude Code version 1.0.39, when using Claude Code with Yarn versions 2.0+, Yarn plugins are auto-executed when running yarn --version. This could lead to a bypass of the directory trust dialog in Claude Code, as plugins would be executed prior to the user accepting the risks of working in an untrusted directory. Users running Yarn Classic were unaffected by this issue. This issue has been fixed in version 1.0.39. Users on standard Claude Code auto-update will have received this fix automatically.

Prior to version 0.1.2, there is a command injection vulnerability in git-commiters. This vulnerability manifests with the library's primary exported API: gitCommiters(options, callback) which allows specifying options such as cwd for current working directory and revisionRange as a revision pointer, such as HEAD. However, the library does not sanitize for user input or practice secure process execution API to separate commands from their arguments and as such, uncontrolled user input is concatenated into command execution. This issue has been patched in version 0.1.2. 2025-09-25 not yet calculated CVE-2025-59831 https://github.com/snowyu/git-commiters.js/security/advisories/GHSA-g38c-wxjf-xrh6 https://github.com/snowyu/git-commiters.js/commit/7f0abfedbf506e3a61ac875d91324a8dbe756e84 monkeytypegame--monkeytype Monkeytype is a minimalistic and customizable typing test.

Prior to version 4.4.8, links generated with LaTeX typesetters in Markdown files and Markdown cells in JupyterLab and Jupyter Notebook did not include the noopener attribute. This is deemed to have no impact on the default installations. Theoretically users of third-party LaTeX-rendering extensions could find themselves vulnerable to reverse tabnabbing attacks if links generated by those extensions included target=_blank (no such extensions are known at time of writing) and they were to click on a link generated in LaTeX (typically visibly different from other links).

In versions prior to 11.0.2, a vulnerability in get-jwks can lead to cache poisoning in the JWKS key-fetching mechanism. When the iss (issuer) claim is validated only after keys are retrieved from the cache, it is possible for cached keys from an unexpected issuer to be reused, resulting in a bypass of issuer validation. This design flaw enables a potential attack where a malicious actor crafts a pair of JWTs, the first one ensuring that a chosen public key is fetched and stored in the shared JWKS cache, and the second one leveraging that cached key to pass signature validation for a targeted iss value. The vulnerability will work only if the iss validation is done after the use of get-jwks for keys retrieval.

The `checkAccess` function in `api/server/middleware/roles/access.js` uses `permissions.some()` to validate permissions, which incorrectly grants access if only one of multiple required permissions is present. This allows users with the 'USER' role to create agents despite having `CREATE: false` permission, as the check for `['USE', 'CREATE']` passes with just `USE: true`. This vulnerability affects other permission checks as well, such as `PROMPTS`.

Vulnerability Summary for the Week of September 22, 2025 rgeraldo Sep 29, 2025 High Vulnerabilities Primary Vendor -- Product Description Published CVSS Score Source Info Patch Info FlowiseAI--Flowise Flowise is a drag & drop user interface to build a customized large language model flow. In version 3.0.5, Flowise is vulnerable to remote code execution. The CustomMCP node allows users to input configuration settings for connecting to an external MCP server. This node parses the user-provided mcpServerConfig string to build the MCP server configuration. However, during this process, it executes JavaScript code without any security validation. Specifically, inside the convertToValidJSONString function, user input is directly passed to the Function() constructor, which evaluates and executes the input as JavaScript code. Since this runs with full Node.js runtime privileges, it can access dangerous modules such as child_process and fs. This issue has been patched in version 3.0.6. 2025-09-22 10 CVE-2025-59528 https://github.com/FlowiseAI/Flowise/security/advisories/GHSA-3gcm-f6qx-ff7p https://github.com/FlowiseAI/Flowise/blob/5930f1119c655bcf8d2200ae827a1f5b9fec81d0/packages/components/nodes/tools/MCP/CustomMCP/CustomMCP.ts#L132 https://github.com/FlowiseAI/Flowise/blob/5930f1119c655bcf8d2200ae827a1f5b9fec81d0/packages/components/nodes/tools/MCP/CustomMCP/CustomMCP.ts#L220 https://github.com/FlowiseAI/Flowise/blob/5930f1119c655bcf8d2200ae827a1f5b9fec81d0/packages/components/nodes/tools/MCP/CustomMCP/CustomMCP.ts#L262-L270 https://github.com/FlowiseAI/Flowise/blob/5930f1119c655bcf8d2200ae827a1f5b9fec81d0/packages/server/src/controllers/nodes/index.ts#L57-L78 https://github.com/FlowiseAI/Flowise/blob/5930f1119c655bcf8d2200ae827a1f5b9fec81d0/packages/server/src/routes/node-load-methods/index.ts#L5 https://github.com/FlowiseAI/Flowise/blob/5930f1119c655bcf8d2200ae827a1f5b9fec81d0/packages/server/src/services/nodes/index.ts#L91-L94 https://github.com/FlowiseAI/Flowise/releases/tag/flowise%403.0.6 HaruTheme--WooCommerce Designer Pro Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type vulnerability in HaruTheme WooCommerce Designer Pro allows Upload a Web Shell to a Web Server.

Prior to version 4.0.1, Formbricks is missing JWT signature verification. This vulnerability stems from a token validation routine that only decodes JWTs (jwt.decode) without verifying their signatures. Both the email verification token login path and the password reset server action use the same validator, which does not check the token's signature, expiration, issuer, or audience. If an attacker learns the victim's actual user.id, they can craft an arbitrary JWT with an alg: "none" header and use it to authenticate and reset the victim's password.

This vulnerability is due to improper handling of crafted Ethernet frames. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted Ethernet frames through an affected switch. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the egress port to which the crafted frame is forwarded to start dropping all frames, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. 2025-09-24 7.4 CVE-2025-20311 cisco-sa-cat9k-PtmD7bgy Cisco--Cisco IOS XE Software A vulnerability in the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) subsystem of Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to improper error handling when parsing a specific SNMP request. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a specific SNMP request to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to reload unexpectedly, resulting in a DoS condition. This vulnerability affects SNMP versions 1, 2c, and 3. To exploit this vulnerability through SNMPv2c or earlier, the attacker must know a valid read-write or read-only SNMP community string for the affected system. To exploit this vulnerability through SNMPv3, the attacker must have valid SNMP user credentials for the affected system. 2025-09-24 7.7 CVE-2025-20312 cisco-sa-snmpwred-x3MJyf5M Cisco--IOS A vulnerability in the web UI of Cisco IOS Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker with low privileges to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to improper input validation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted URL in an HTTP request. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition. 2025-09-24 7.7 CVE-2025-20327 cisco-sa-ios-invalid-url-dos-Nvxszf6u Cisco--IOS A vulnerability in the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) subsystem of Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software could allow the following: An authenticated, remote attacker with low privileges could cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device that is running Cisco IOS Software or Cisco IOS XE Software. To cause the DoS, the attacker must have the SNMPv2c or earlier read-only community string or valid SNMPv3 user credentials. An authenticated, remote attacker with high privileges could execute code as the root user on an affected device that is running Cisco IOS XE Software. To execute code as the root user, the attacker must have the SNMPv1 or v2c read-only community string or valid SNMPv3 user credentials and administrative or privilege 15 credentials on the affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted SNMP packet to an affected device over IPv4 or IPv6 networks. This vulnerability is due to a stack overflow condition in the SNMP subsystem of the affected software. A successful exploit could allow a low-privileged attacker to cause the affected system to reload, resulting in a DoS condition, or allow a high-privileged attacker to execute arbitrary code as the root user and obtain full control of the affected system. Note: This vulnerability affects all versions of SNMP. 2025-09-24 7.7 CVE-2025-20352 cisco-sa-snmp-x4LPhte Qualcomm, Inc.--Snapdragon Memory corruption when passing parameters to the Trusted Virtual Machine during the handshake. 2025-09-24 7.8 CVE-2025-21476 https://docs.qualcomm.com/product/publicresources/securitybulletin/september-2025-bulletin.html Qualcomm, Inc.--Snapdragon Memory corruption while performing private key encryption in trusted application. 2025-09-24 7.8 CVE-2025-21481 https://docs.qualcomm.com/product/publicresources/securitybulletin/september-2025-bulletin.html Qualcomm, Inc.--Snapdragon Cryptographic issue while performing RSA PKCS padding decoding. 2025-09-24 7.1 CVE-2025-21482 https://docs.qualcomm.com/product/publicresources/securitybulletin/september-2025-bulletin.html NVIDIA--Megatron-LM NVIDIA Megatron-LM for all platforms contains a vulnerability in the pretrain_gpt script, where malicious data created by an attacker may cause a code injection issue.

An authenticated Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability exists in Horilla 1.3.0 due to the unsafe use of Python's eval() function on a user-controlled query parameter in the project_bulk_archive view. This allows privileged users (e.g., administrators) to execute arbitrary system commands on the server. While having Django's DEBUG=True makes exploitation visibly easier by returning command output in the HTTP response, this is not required. The vulnerability can still be exploited in DEBUG=False mode by using blind payloads such as a reverse shell, leading to full remote code execution.

Prior to version 6.5.11, there is an absence of automatic session expiration following a user's password change. This oversight poses a security risk, as if a user forgets to log out from a location where they accessed their account, an unauthorized user can maintain access even after the password has been changed. Due to this bug, if an account has already been compromised, the legitimate user has no way to revoke the attacker's access. The malicious actor retains full access to the account until their session naturally expires. This means the account remains insecure even after the password has been changed. This issue has been patched in version 6.5.11. 2025-09-22 7.1 CVE-2025-59335 https://github.com/cubecart/v6/security/advisories/GHSA-4vwh-x8m2-fmvv https://github.com/cubecart/v6/commit/4bfaeb4485dd82255a108940a163af5ba4583b52 https://github.com/cubecart/v6/commit/62d9be8416aa6fd7343f8932d98c5b112b163e26 authlib--authlib Authlib is a Python library which builds OAuth and OpenID Connect servers. Prior to version 1.6.4, Authlib's JWS verification accepts tokens that declare unknown critical header parameters (crit), violating RFC 7515 "must understand" semantics. An attacker can craft a signed token with a critical header (for example, bork or cnf) that strict verifiers reject but Authlib accepts. In mixed language fleets, this enables split brain verification and can lead to policy bypass, replay, or privilege escalation. This issue has been patched in version 1.6.4. 2025-09-22 7.5 CVE-2025-59420 https://github.com/authlib/authlib/security/advisories/GHSA-9ggr-2464-2j32 https://github.com/authlib/authlib/commit/6b1813e4392eb7c168c276099ff7783b176479df FlowiseAI--Flowise Flowise is a drag & drop user interface to build a customized large language model flow.

A malicious actor can exploit this vulnerability by injecting a crafted payload that is reflected in the server response, enabling the execution of arbitrary JavaScript in the victim's browser. This vulnerability could allow attackers to redirect users to malicious websites, modify the user interface, or exfiltrate data from the browser. However, session-related sensitive cookies are protected using the httpOnly flag, which mitigates the risk of session hijacking. 2025-09-23 6.1 CVE-2025-0209 https://security.docs.wso2.com/en/latest/security-announcements/security-advisories/2025/WSO2-2025-3902/ WSO2--WSO2 Open Banking IAM A cross-tenant authentication vulnerability exists in multiple WSO2 products due to improper cryptographic design in Adaptive Authentication. A single cryptographic key is used across all tenants to sign authentication cookies, allowing a privileged user in one tenant to forge authentication cookies for users in other tenants. Because the Auto-Login feature is enabled by default, this flaw may allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access and potentially take over accounts in other tenants. Successful exploitation requires access to Adaptive Authentication functionality, which is typically restricted to high-privileged users. The vulnerability is only exploitable when Auto-Login is enabled, reducing its practical impact in deployments where the feature is disabled. 2025-09-23 6.8 CVE-2025-0663 https://security.docs.wso2.com/en/latest/security-announcements/security-advisories/2025/WSO2-2025-3864/ douglaskarr--TweetThis Shortcode The TweetThis Shortcode plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's 'tweetthis' shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 1.8.0 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes.

A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability was discovered in the handling of user-supplied input in the Bundles, Comments, and Sightings components. Untrusted data was not properly sanitized before being rendered in templates and tables, which could allow attackers to inject arbitrary JavaScript into the application. The issue was due to unsafe use of innerHTML and insufficient validation of dynamic URLs and model fields. This vulnerability has been fixed by escaping untrusted data, replacing innerHTML assignments with safer DOM methods, encoding URLs with encodeURIComponent, and improving input validation in the affected models. 2025-09-25 6.4 CVE-2025-60249 https://github.com/vulnerability-lookup/vulnerability-lookup/commit/afa12347f1461d9481eba75ac19897e80a9c7434 Webbeyaz Website Design--Website Software Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation (XSS or 'Cross-site Scripting') vulnerability in Webbeyaz Website Design Website Software allows Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).This issue affects Website Software: through 2025.07.14. 2025-09-26 6.1 CVE-2025-6396 https://www.usom.gov.tr/bildirim/tr-25-0302 GitLab--GitLab A privilege escalation issue has been discovered in GitLab EE affecting all versions from 16.6 prior to 18.2.7, 18.3 prior to 18.3.3, and 18.4 prior to 18.4.1 that could have allowed a developer with specific group management permissions to escalate their privileges and obtain unauthorized access to additional system capabilities. 2025-09-26 6.5 CVE-2025-7691 GitLab Issue #555786 HackerOne Bug Bounty Report #3200469 kraftplugins--Mega Elements Addons for Elementor The Mega Elements - Addons for Elementor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's Countdown Timer widget in all versions up to, and including, 1.3.2 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes.

This vulnerability is due to incomplete cleanup upon completion of the Day One setup process. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending Simple Certificate Enrollment Protocol (SCEP) requests to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to request a certificate from the virtual wireless controller and then use the acquired certificate to join an attacker-controlled device to the virtual wireless controller. 2025-09-24 5.3 CVE-2025-20293 cisco-sa-9800cl-openscep-SB4xtxzP Cisco--Cisco IOS XE Software A vulnerability in the access control list (ACL) programming of Cisco IOS XE Software for Cisco Catalyst 9500X and 9600X Series Switches could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass a configured ACL on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to the flooding of traffic from an unlearned MAC address on a switch virtual interface (SVI) that has an egress ACL applied. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by causing the VLAN to flush its MAC address table. This condition can also occur if the MAC address table is full. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass an egress ACL on an affected device. 2025-09-24 5.3 CVE-2025-20316 cisco-sa-cat9k-acl-L4K7VXgD Cisco--Cisco SD-WAN vEdge Cloud A vulnerability in the access control list (ACL) processing of IPv4 packets of Cisco SD-WAN vEdge Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass a configured ACL. This vulnerability is due to the improper enforcement of the implicit deny all at the end of a configured ACL.

Prior to version 6.5.11, the contact form's Enquiry field accepts raw HTML and that HTML is included verbatim in the email sent to the store admin. By submitting HTML in the Enquiry, the admin receives an email containing that HTML. This indicates user input is not being escaped or sanitized before being output in email (and possibly when re-rendering the form), leading to Cross-Site Scripting / HTML injection risk in email clients or admin UI.

Prior to version 6.5.11, a vulnerability exists in the product reviews feature where user-supplied input is not properly sanitized before being displayed. An attacker can submit HTML tags inside the review description field. Once the administrator approves the review, the injected HTML is rendered on the product page for all visitors. This could be used to redirect users to malicious websites or to display unwanted content.

Prior to version 2.0.0, @conventional-changelog/git-client has an argument injection vulnerability. This vulnerability manifests with the library's getTags() API, which allows extra parameters to be passed to the git log command. In another API by this library, getRawCommits(), there are secure practices taken to ensure that the extra parameter path is unable to inject an argument by ending the git log command with the special shell syntax --. However, the library does not follow the same practice for getTags() as it does not attempt to sanitize for user input, validate the given params, or restrict them to an allow list. Nor does it properly pass command-line flags to the git binary using the double-dash POSIX characters (--) to communicate the end of options. Thus, allowing users to exploit an argument injection vulnerability in Git due to the --output= command-line option that results with overwriting arbitrary files.

Prior to version 1.130.1, the project's OIDC redirect handling logic constructs the host and protocol of the final redirect URL based on the X-Forwarded-Host or Host headers and the X-Forwarded-Proto value. In deployments where a reverse proxy forwards client-supplied X-Forwarded-* headers to the origin as-is, or where the origin trusts them without validation, an attacker can inject an arbitrary host and trigger an open redirect that sends users to a malicious domain.

Because the proxy forwards requests and headers, an attacker can reach internal-only endpoints and link-local metadata services, retrieve instance role credentials or other sensitive metadata, and interact with internal APIs and services that are not intended to be internet-facing. The vulnerability is exploitable by sending crafted requests to the proxy with the target resource encoded in the URL; many cors-anywhere deployments forward arbitrary methods and headers (including PUT), which can permit exploitation of IMDSv2 workflows as well as access to internal management APIs. Successful exploitation can result in theft of cloud credentials, unauthorized access to internal services, remote code execution or privilege escalation (depending on reachable backends), data exfiltration, and full compromise of cloud resources. Mitigation includes: restricting the proxy to trusted origins or authentication, whitelisting allowed target hosts, preventing access to link-local and internal IP ranges, removing support for unsafe HTTP methods/headers, enabling cloud provider mitigations, and deploying network-level protections. 2025-09-25 not yet calculated CVE-2020-36851 https://github.com/Rob--W/cors-anywhere/issues/152 https://github.com/Rob--W/cors-anywhere/issues/78 https://www.certik.com/resources/blog/cors-anywhere-dangers-of-misconfigured-third-party-software https://www.vulncheck.com/advisories/rob-w-cors-anywhere-misconfigured-cors-proxy-allows-ssrf https://github.com/SocketDev/security-research/security/advisories/GHSA-9wmg-93pw-fc3g https://github.com/Rob--W/cors-anywhere/issues/521 Linux--Linux In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: Bluetooth: hci_core: Disable works on hci_unregister_dev This make use of disable_work_* on hci_unregister_dev since the hci_dev is about to be freed new submissions are not disarable. 2025-09-24 not yet calculated CVE-2024-58241 https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/cfdb13a54e05eb98d9940cb6d1a13e7f994d811f https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/989fa5171f005ecf63440057218d8aeb1795287d Invoice Ninja--Invoice Ninja 5 Incorrect handling of uploaded files in the admin "Restore" function in Invoice Ninja <= 5.11.72 allows attackers with admin credentials to execute arbitrary code on the server via uploaded .php files. 2025-09-22 not yet calculated CVE-2025-10009 https://github.com/invoiceninja/invoiceninja/commit/02151b570b226b4584a8e61b06b10be9366da3de OnePlus--OxygenOS The vulnerability allows any application installed on the device to read SMS/MMS data and metadata from the system-provided Telephony provider without permission, user interaction, or consent. The user is also not notified that SMS data is being accessed.

Due to a software bug, the configuration to restrict commands was ignored when passed to ECI, allowing any command to be executed on the socket. This grants excessive privileges by permitting unrestricted access to powerful Docker commands. The vulnerability affects only Docker Desktop 4.46.0 users that have ECI enabled and are using the Docker socket command restrictions feature.

The code declared queue_priority_map as s8 (*)[2] (pointer to array of 2 s8), but allocated memory using sizeof(s8) instead of the correct size. This caused out-of-bounds memory writes when accessing: queue_priority_map[i][0] = i; queue_priority_map[i][1] = i; The bug manifested as kernel crashes with "Oops - undefined instruction" on ARM platforms (BeagleBoard-X15) during EDMA driver probe, as the memory corruption triggered kernel hardening features on Clang. Change the allocation to use sizeof(*queue_priority_map) which automatically gets the correct size for the 2D array structure. 2025-09-23 not yet calculated CVE-2025-39869 https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/5e462fa0dfdb52b3983cf41532d3d4c7d63e2f93 https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/1baed10553fc8b388351d8fc803e3ae6f1a863bc https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/069fd1688c57c0cc8a3de64d108579b31676f74b https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/d5e82f3f2c918d446df46e8d65f8083fd97cdec5 https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/e63419dbf2ceb083c1651852209c7f048089ac0f Linux--Linux In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: dmaengine: idxd: Fix double free in idxd_setup_wqs() The clean up in idxd_setup_wqs() has had a couple bugs because the error handling is a bit subtle. It's simpler to just re-write it in a cleaner way. The issues here are: 1) If "idxd->max_wqs" is <= 0 then we call put_device(conf_dev) when "conf_dev" hasn't been initialized. 2) If kzalloc_node() fails then again "conf_dev" is invalid. It's either uninitialized or it points to the "conf_dev" from the previous iteration so it leads to a double free. It's better to free partial loop iterations within the loop and then the unwinding at the end can handle whole loop iterations. I also renamed the labels to describe what the goto does and not where the goto was located. 2025-09-23 not yet calculated CVE-2025-39870 https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/25e6146c2812487a88f619d5ff6efbdcd5b2bc31 https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/df82c7901513fd0fc738052a8e6a330d92cc8ec9 https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/ec5430d090d0b6ace8fefa290fc37e88930017d2 https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/9f0e225635475b2285b966271d5e82cba74295b1 https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/39aaa337449e71a41d4813be0226a722827ba606 Linux--Linux In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: dmaengine: idxd: Remove improper idxd_free The call to idxd_free() introduces a duplicate put_device() leading to a reference count underflow: refcount_t: underflow; use-after-free.

An earlier fix commit 3d3c817c3a40 ("can: xilinx_can: Fix usage of skb memory") did not move the can_put_echo_skb() call far enough.

Therefore, simply use 0 as the last parameter. 2025-09-23 not yet calculated CVE-2025-39875 https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/473be7d39efd3be383e9c0c8e44b53508b4ffeb5 https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/75871a525a596ff4d16c4aebc0018f8d0923c9b1 Linux--Linux In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: net: fec: Fix possible NPD in fec_enet_phy_reset_after_clk_enable() The function of_phy_find_device may return NULL, so we need to take care before dereferencing phy_dev. 2025-09-23 not yet calculated CVE-2025-39876 https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/5f1bb554a131e59b28482abad21f691390651752 https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/fe78891f296ac05bf4e5295c9829ef822f3c32e7 https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/4fe53aaa4271a72fe5fe3e88a45ce01646b68dc5 https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/eb148d85e126c47d65be34f2a465d69432ca5541 https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/03e79de4608bdd48ad6eec272e196124cefaf798 Linux--Linux In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: mm/damon/sysfs: fix use-after-free in state_show() state_show() reads kdamond->damon_ctx without holding damon_sysfs_lock.

This new function is supposed to return an error code which is checked by the caller (now ceph_process_folio_batch()), and on error, the caller invokes redirty_page_for_writepage() and then breaks from the loop. However, the refactoring commit has gone wrong, and it by accident, it always returns 0 (= success) because it first NULLs the pointer and then returns PTR_ERR(NULL) which is always 0. This means errors are silently ignored, leaving NULL entries in the page array, which may later crash the kernel. The simple solution is to call PTR_ERR() before clearing the pointer. 2025-09-23 not yet calculated CVE-2025-39878 https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/dd1616ecbea920d228c56729461ed223cc501425 https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/249e0a47cdb46bb9eae65511c569044bd8698d7d Linux--Linux In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: ceph: always call ceph_shift_unused_folios_left() The function ceph_process_folio_batch() sets folio_batch entries to NULL, which is an illegal state. Before folio_batch_release() crashes due to this API violation, the function ceph_shift_unused_folios_left() is supposed to remove those NULLs from the array. However, since commit ce80b76dd327 ("ceph: introduce ceph_process_folio_batch() method"), this shifting doesn't happen anymore because the "for" loop got moved to ceph_process_folio_batch(), and now the `i` variable that remains in ceph_writepages_start() doesn't get incremented anymore, making the shifting effectively unreachable much of the time. Later, commit 1551ec61dc55 ("ceph: introduce ceph_submit_write() method") added more preconditions for doing the shift, replacing the `i` check (with something that is still just as broken): - if ceph_process_folio_batch() fails, shifting never happens - if ceph_move_dirty_page_in_page_array() was never called (because ceph_process_folio_batch() has returned early for some of various reasons), shifting never happens - if `processed_in_fbatch` is zero (because ceph_process_folio_batch() has returned early for some of the reasons mentioned above or because ceph_move_dirty_page_in_page_array() has failed), shifting never happens Since those two commits, any problem in ceph_process_folio_batch() could crash the kernel, e.g. this way: BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000034 #PF: supervisor write access in kernel mode #PF: error_code(0x0002) - not-present page PGD 0 P4D 0 Oops: Oops: 0002 [#1] SMP NOPTI CPU: 172 UID: 0 PID: 2342707 Comm: kworker/u778:8 Not tainted 6.15.10-cm4all1-es #714 NONE Hardware name: Dell Inc.

(Interestingly, the crash happens only if `huge_zero_folio` has already been allocated; without `huge_zero_folio`, is_huge_zero_folio(NULL) returns true and folios_put_refs() skips NULL entries instead of dereferencing them. That makes reproducing the bug somewhat unreliable. See https://lore.kernel.org/20250826231626.218675-1-max.kellermann@ionos.com for a discussion of this detail.) My suggestion is to move the ceph_shift_unused_folios_left() to right after ceph_process_folio_batch() to ensure it always gets called to fix up the illegal folio_batch state. 2025-09-23 not yet calculated CVE-2025-39879 https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/289b6615cf553d98509a9b273195d9936da1cfb2 https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/cce7c15faaac79b532a07ed6ab8332280ad83762 Linux--Linux In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: libceph: fix invalid accesses to ceph_connection_v1_info There is a place where generic code in messenger.c is reading and another place where it is writing to con->v1 union member without checking that the union member is active (i.e. msgr1 is in use). On 64-bit systems, con->v1.auth_retry overlaps with con->v2.out_iter, so such a read is almost guaranteed to return a bogus value instead of 0 when msgr2 is in use. This ends up being fairly benign because the side effect is just the invalidation of the authorizer and successive fetching of new tickets. con->v1.connect_seq overlaps with con->v2.conn_bufs and the fact that it's being written to can cause more serious consequences, but luckily it's not something that happens often. 2025-09-23 not yet calculated CVE-2025-39880 https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/591ea9c30737663a471b2bb07b27ddde86b020d5 https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/23538cfbeed87159a5ac6c61e7a6de3d8d4486a8 https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/35dbbc3dbf8bccb2d77c68444f42c1e6d2d27983 https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/6bd8b56899be0b514945f639a89ccafb8f8dfaef https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/cdbc9836c7afadad68f374791738f118263c5371 Linux--Linux In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: kernfs: Fix UAF in polling when open file is released A use-after-free (UAF) vulnerability was identified in the PSI (Pressure Stall Information) monitoring mechanism: BUG: KASAN: slab-use-after-free in psi_trigger_poll+0x3c/0x140 Read of size 8 at addr ffff3de3d50bd308 by task systemd/1 psi_trigger_poll+0x3c/0x140 cgroup_pressure_poll+0x70/0xa0 cgroup_file_poll+0x8c/0x100 kernfs_fop_poll+0x11c/0x1c0 ep_item_poll.isra.0+0x188/0x2c0 Allocated by task 1: cgroup_file_open+0x88/0x388 kernfs_fop_open+0x73c/0xaf0 do_dentry_open+0x5fc/0x1200 vfs_open+0xa0/0x3f0 do_open+0x7e8/0xd08 path_openat+0x2fc/0x6b0 do_filp_open+0x174/0x368 Freed by task 8462: cgroup_file_release+0x130/0x1f8 kernfs_drain_open_files+0x17c/0x440 kernfs_drain+0x2dc/0x360 kernfs_show+0x1b8/0x288 cgroup_file_show+0x150/0x268 cgroup_pressure_write+0x1dc/0x340 cgroup_file_write+0x274/0x548 Reproduction Steps: 1.

Specifically, there is a window during evict() between the inode being unhashed and deleted from the xarray. If btrfs_iget() is called for the same inode in that window, it will be recreated and inserted into the xarray, but then eviction will delete the new entry, leaving nothing in the xarray: Thread 1 Thread 2 --------------------------------------------------------------- evict() remove_inode_hash() btrfs_iget_path() btrfs_iget_locked() btrfs_read_locked_inode() btrfs_add_inode_to_root() destroy_inode() btrfs_destroy_inode() btrfs_del_inode_from_root() __xa_erase In turn, this can cause issues for subvolume deletion. Specifically, if an inode is in this lost state, and all other inodes are evicted, then btrfs_del_inode_from_root() will call btrfs_add_dead_root() prematurely. If the lost inode has a delayed_node attached to it, then when btrfs_clean_one_deleted_snapshot() calls btrfs_kill_all_delayed_nodes(), it will loop forever because the delayed_nodes xarray will never become empty (unless memory pressure forces the inode out). We saw this manifest as soft lockups in production. Fix it by only deleting the xarray entry if it matches the given inode (using __xa_cmpxchg()). 2025-09-23 not yet calculated CVE-2025-39884 https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/9ba898c9fcbe6ebb88bcd4df8aab0f90090d202e https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/f1498abaf74f8d7b1e7001f16ed77818d8ae6a59 https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/f6a6c280059c4ddc23e12e3de1b01098e240036f Linux--Linux In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: ocfs2: fix recursive semaphore deadlock in fiemap call syzbot detected a OCFS2 hang due to a recursive semaphore on a FS_IOC_FIEMAP of the extent list on a specially crafted mmap file. context_switch kernel/sched/core.c:5357 [inline] __schedule+0x1798/0x4cc0 kernel/sched/core.c:6961 __schedule_loop kernel/sched/core.c:7043 [inline] schedule+0x165/0x360 kernel/sched/core.c:7058 schedule_preempt_disabled+0x13/0x30 kernel/sched/core.c:7115 rwsem_down_write_slowpath+0x872/0xfe0 kernel/locking/rwsem.c:1185 __down_write_common kernel/locking/rwsem.c:1317 [inline] __down_write kernel/locking/rwsem.c:1326 [inline] down_write+0x1ab/0x1f0 kernel/locking/rwsem.c:1591 ocfs2_page_mkwrite+0x2ff/0xc40 fs/ocfs2/mmap.c:142 do_page_mkwrite+0x14d/0x310 mm/memory.c:3361 wp_page_shared mm/memory.c:3762 [inline] do_wp_page+0x268d/0x5800 mm/memory.c:3981 handle_pte_fault mm/memory.c:6068 [inline] __handle_mm_fault+0x1033/0x5440 mm/memory.c:6195 handle_mm_fault+0x40a/0x8e0 mm/memory.c:6364 do_user_addr_fault+0x764/0x1390 arch/x86/mm/fault.c:1387 handle_page_fault arch/x86/mm/fault.c:1476 [inline] exc_page_fault+0x76/0xf0 arch/x86/mm/fault.c:1532 asm_exc_page_fault+0x26/0x30 arch/x86/include/asm/idtentry.h:623 RIP: 0010:copy_user_generic arch/x86/include/asm/uaccess_64.h:126 [inline] RIP: 0010:raw_copy_to_user arch/x86/include/asm/uaccess_64.h:147 [inline] RIP: 0010:_inline_copy_to_user include/linux/uaccess.h:197 [inline] RIP: 0010:_copy_to_user+0x85/0xb0 lib/usercopy.c:26 Code: e8 00 bc f7 fc 4d 39 fc 72 3d 4d 39 ec 77 38 e8 91 b9 f7 fc 4c 89 f7 89 de e8 47 25 5b fd 0f 01 cb 4c 89 ff 48 89 d9 4c 89 f6 a4 0f 1f 00 48 89 cb 0f 01 ca 48 89 d8 5b 41 5c 41 5d 41 5e 41 RSP: 0018:ffffc9000403f950 EFLAGS: 00050256 RAX: ffffffff84c7f101 RBX: 0000000000000038 RCX: 0000000000000038 RDX: 0000000000000000 RSI: ffffc9000403f9e0 RDI: 0000200000000060 RBP: ffffc9000403fa90 R08: ffffc9000403fa17 R09: 1ffff92000807f42 R10: dffffc0000000000 R11: fffff52000807f43 R12: 0000200000000098 R13: 00007ffffffff000 R14: ffffc9000403f9e0 R15: 0000200000000060 copy_to_user include/linux/uaccess.h:225 [inline] fiemap_fill_next_extent+0x1c0/0x390 fs/ioctl.c:145 ocfs2_fiemap+0x888/0xc90 fs/ocfs2/extent_map.c:806 ioctl_fiemap fs/ioctl.c:220 [inline] do_vfs_ioctl+0x1173/0x1430 fs/ioctl.c:532 __do_sys_ioctl fs/ioctl.c:596 [inline] __se_sys_ioctl+0x82/0x170 fs/ioctl.c:584 do_syscall_x64 arch/x86/entry/syscall_64.c:63 [inline] do_syscall_64+0xfa/0x3b0 arch/x86/entry/syscall_64.c:94 entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x77/0x7f RIP: 0033:0x7f5f13850fd9 RSP: 002b:00007ffe3b3518b8 EFLAGS: 00000246 ORIG_RAX: 0000000000000010 RAX: ffffffffffffffda RBX: 0000200000000000 RCX: 00007f5f13850fd9 RDX: 0000200000000040 RSI: 00000000c020660b RDI: 0000000000000004 RBP: 6165627472616568 R08: 0000000000000000 R09: 0000000000000000 R10: 0000000000000000 R11: 0000000000000246 R12: 00007ffe3b3518f0 R13: 00007ffe3b351b18 R14: 431bde82d7b634db R15: 00007f5f1389a03b ocfs2_fiemap() takes a read lock of the ip_alloc_sem semaphore (since v2.6.22-527-g7307de80510a) and calls fiemap_fill_next_extent() to read the extent list of this running mmap executable. The user supplied buffer to hold the fiemap information page faults calling ocfs2_page_mkwrite() which will take a write lock (since v2.6.27-38-g00dc417fa3e7) of the same semaphore. This recursive semaphore will hold filesystem locks and causes a hang of the fileystem. The ip_alloc_sem protects the inode extent list and size. Release the read semphore before calling fiemap_fill_next_extent() in ocfs2_fiemap() and ocfs2_fiemap_inline(). This does an unnecessary semaphore lock/unlock on the last extent but simplifies the error path. 2025-09-23 not yet calculated CVE-2025-39885 https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/36054554772f95d090eb45793faf6aa3c0254b02 https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/0709bc11b942870fc0a7be150e42aea42321093a https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/1d3c96547ee2ddeaddf8f19a3ef99ea06cc8115e https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/9efcb7a8b97310efed995397941a292cf89fa94f https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/04100f775c2ea501927f508f17ad824ad1f23c8d Linux--Linux In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: bpf: Tell memcg to use allow_spinning=false path in bpf_timer_init() Currently, calling bpf_map_kmalloc_node() from __bpf_async_init() can cause various locking issues; see the following stack trace (edited for style) as one example: ...

The above was reproduced on bpf-next (b338cf849ec8) by modifying ./tools/sched_ext/scx_flatcg.bpf.c to call bpf_timer_init() during ops.runnable(), and hacking the memcg accounting code a bit to make a bpf_timer_init() call more likely to raise an MEMCG_MAX event. We have also run into other similar variants (both internally and on bpf-next), including double-acquiring cgroup_file_kn_lock, the same worker_pool::lock, etc. As suggested by Shakeel, fix this by using __GFP_HIGH instead of GFP_ATOMIC in __bpf_async_init(), so that e.g. if try_charge_memcg() raises an MEMCG_MAX event, we call __memcg_memory_event() with @allow_spinning=false and avoid calling cgroup_file_notify() there.

The intent was to restrict access to sensitive connection fields to Connection Editing Users, effectively applying a "write-only" model for sensitive values. In Airflow 3.0.3, this model was unintentionally violated: sensitive connection information could be viewed by users with READ permissions through both the API and the UI. This behavior also bypassed the `AIRFLOW__CORE__HIDE_SENSITIVE_VAR_CONN_FIELDS` configuration option. This issue does not affect Airflow 2.x, where exposing sensitive information to connection editors was the intended and documented behavior.

When an administrator initiates "Open Remote Terminal" from the AiKaan dashboard, the controller sends this same static private key to the target device. The device then uses it to establish a reverse SSH tunnel to a remote access server, enabling browser-based SSH access for the administrator. Because the same `proxyuser` account and SSH key are reused across all customer environments: - An attacker who obtains the key (e.g., by intercepting it in transit, extracting it from the remote access server, or from a compromised admin account) can impersonate any managed device. - They can establish unauthorized reverse SSH tunnels and interact with devices without the owner's consent. This is a design flaw in the authentication model: compromise of a single key compromises the trust boundary between the controller and devices. 2025-09-22 not yet calculated CVE-2025-57601 https://github.com/Shubhangborkar/aikaan-vulnerabilities/blob/main/cve1-shared-ssh-key.md AiKaan IoT Manager -- n/a Insufficient hardening of the proxyuser account in the AiKaan IoT management platform, combined with the use of a shared, hardcoded SSH private key, allows remote attackers to authenticate to the cloud controller, gain interactive shell access, and pivot into other connected IoT devices.

Prior to version 3.2, a timing attack vulnerability exists in the SCRAM Java implementation. The issue arises because Arrays.equals was used to compare secret values such as client proofs and server signatures. Since Arrays.equals performs a short-circuit comparison, the execution time varies depending on how many leading bytes match. This behavior could allow an attacker to perform a timing side-channel attack and potentially infer sensitive authentication material. All users relying on SCRAM authentication are impacted.

Prior to version 4.4.8, links generated with LaTeX typesetters in Markdown files and Markdown cells in JupyterLab and Jupyter Notebook did not include the noopener attribute. This is deemed to have no impact on the default installations. Theoretically users of third-party LaTeX-rendering extensions could find themselves vulnerable to reverse tabnabbing attacks if links generated by those extensions included target=_blank (no such extensions are known at time of writing) and they were to click on a link generated in LaTeX (typically visibly different from other links). This issue has been patched in version 4.4.8. 2025-09-26 not yet calculated CVE-2025-59842 https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/security/advisories/GHSA-vvfj-2jqx-52jm https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/commit/88ef373039a8cc09f27d3814382a512d9033675c FlagForgeCTF--flagForge Flag Forge is a Capture The Flag (CTF) platform. From versions 2.0.0 to before 2.3.1, the public endpoint /api/user/[username] returns user email addresses in its JSON response. The problem has been patched in FlagForge version 2.3.1. The fix removes email addresses from public API responses while keeping the endpoint publicly accessible. Users should upgrade to version 2.3.1 or later to eliminate exposure. There are no workarounds for this vulnerability. 2025-09-26 not yet calculated CVE-2025-59843 https://github.com/FlagForgeCTF/flagForge/security/advisories/GHSA-qqjv-8r5p-7xpj SonarSource--sonarqube-scan-action SonarQube Server and Cloud is a static analysis solution for continuous code quality and security inspection. A command injection vulnerability exists in SonarQube GitHub Action in version 4.0.0 to before version 6.0.0 when workflows pass user-controlled input to the args parameter on Windows runners without proper validation. This vulnerability bypasses a previous security fix and allows arbitrary command execution, potentially leading to exposure of sensitive environment variables and compromise of the runner environment. The vulnerability has been fixed in version 6.0.0. Users should upgrade to this version or later. 2025-09-26 not yet calculated CVE-2025-59844 https://github.com/SonarSource/sonarqube-scan-action/security/advisories/GHSA-5xq9-5g24-4g6f https://community.sonarsource.com/t/sonarqube-scanner-github-action-v6/149281 https://github.com/SonarSource/sonarqube-scan-action/releases/tag/v6.0.0 nearform--get-jwks get-jwks contains fetch utils for JWKS keys. In versions prior to 11.0.2, a vulnerability in get-jwks can lead to cache poisoning in the JWKS key-fetching mechanism. When the iss (issuer) claim is validated only after keys are retrieved from the cache, it is possible for cached keys from an unexpected issuer to be reused, resulting in a bypass of issuer validation. This design flaw enables a potential attack where a malicious actor crafts a pair of JWTs, the first one ensuring that a chosen public key is fetched and stored in the shared JWKS cache, and the second one leveraging that cached key to pass signature validation for a targeted iss value. The vulnerability will work only if the iss validation is done after the use of get-jwks for keys retrieval. This issue has been patched in version 11.0.2. 2025-09-27 not yet calculated CVE-2025-59936 https://github.com/nearform/get-jwks/security/advisories/GHSA-qc2q-qhf3-235m https://github.com/nearform/get-jwks/commit/1706a177a80a1759fe68e3339dc5a219ce03ddb9 huggingface--huggingface/transformers The huggingface/transformers library, versions prior to 4.53.0, is vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) in the AdamWeightDecay optimizer. The vulnerability arises from the _do_use_weight_decay method, which processes user-controlled regular expressions in the include_in_weight_decay and exclude_from_weight_decay lists. Malicious regular expressions can cause catastrophic backtracking during the re.search call, leading to 100% CPU utilization and a denial of service. This issue can be exploited by attackers who can control the patterns in these lists, potentially causing the machine learning task to hang and rendering services unresponsive. 2025-09-23 not yet calculated CVE-2025-6921 https://huntr.com/bounties/287d15a7-6e7c-45d2-8c05-11e305776f1f https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/commit/47c34fba5c303576560cb29767efb452ff12b8be danny-avila--danny-avila/librechat danny-avila/librechat is affected by an authorization bypass vulnerability due to improper access control checks. The `checkAccess` function in `api/server/middleware/roles/access.js` uses `permissions.some()` to validate permissions, which incorrectly grants access if only one of multiple required permissions is present. This allows users with the 'USER' role to create agents despite having `CREATE: false` permission, as the check for `['USE', 'CREATE']` passes with just `USE: true`. This vulnerability affects other permission checks as well, such as `PROMPTS`. The issue is present in all versions prior to the fix. 2025-09-23 not yet calculated CVE-2025-7106 https://huntr.com/bounties/7de2765b-d1fe-4495-9144-220070857c48 https://github.com/danny-avila/librechat/commit/91a2df47599c09d80886bfc28e0ccf1debd42110 run-llama--run-llama/llama_index The llama-index-core package, up to version 0.12.44, contains a vulnerability in the `get_cache_dir()` function where a predictable, hardcoded directory path `/tmp/llama_index` is used on Linux systems without proper security controls. This vulnerability allows attackers on multi-user systems to steal proprietary models, poison cached embeddings, or conduct symlink attacks. The issue affects all Linux deployments where multiple users share the same system. The vulnerability is classified under CWE-379, CWE-377, and CWE-367, indicating insecure temporary file creation and potential race conditions. 2025-09-27 not yet calculated CVE-2025-7647 https://huntr.com/bounties/a2baa08f-98bf-47a8-ac83-06f7411afd9e https://github.com/run-llama/llama_index/commit/98816394d57c7f53f847ed7b60725e69d0e7aae4 Unknown--SureForms The SureForms WordPress plugin before 1.9.1 does not sanitise and escape some parameters when outputing them in the page, which could allow admin and above users to perform Cross-Site Scripting attacks. 2025-09-23 not yet calculated CVE-2025-8282 https://wpscan.com/vulnerability/62680106-1313-4ef0-80a5-33e93b4221a1/ RTI--Connext Professional Use After Free vulnerability in RTI Connext Professional (Security Plugins) allows File Manipulation.This issue affects Connext Professional: from 7.5.0 before 7.6.0. 2025-09-23 not yet calculated CVE-2025-8410 https://www.rti.com/vulnerabilities/#cve-2025-8410 Python Packaging Authority--pip When extracting a tar archive pip may not check symbolic links point into the extraction directory if the tarfile module doesn't implement PEP 706. Note that upgrading pip to a "fixed" version for this vulnerability doesn't fix all known vulnerabilities that are remediated by using a Python version that implements PEP 706. Note that this is a vulnerability in pip's fallback implementation of tar extraction for Python versions that don't implement PEP 706 and therefore are not secure to all vulnerabilities in the Python 'tarfile' module. If you're using a Python version that implements PEP 706 then pip doesn't use the "vulnerable" fallback code. Mitigations include upgrading to a version of pip that includes the fix, upgrading to a Python version that implements PEP 706 (Python >=3.9.17, >=3.10.12, >=3.11.4, or >=3.12), applying the linked patch, or inspecting source distributions (sdists) before installation as is already a best-practice. 2025-09-24 not yet calculated CVE-2025-8869 https://github.com/pypa/pip/pull/13550 https://mail.python.org/archives/list/security-announce@python.org/thread/IF5A3GCJY3VH7BVHJKOWOJFKTW7VFQEN/ GE Vernova--S1 Agile Configuration Software Improper Privilege Management vulnerability in GE Vernova S1 Agile Configuration Software on Windows allows Privilege Escalation.This issue affects S1 Agile Configuration Software: 3.1 and previous version. 2025-09-22 not yet calculated CVE-2025-9038 https://www.gevernova.com/grid-solutions/sites/default/files/resources/products/support/ges-2025-001.pdf Unknown--Etsy Shop The Etsy Shop WordPress plugin before 3.0.7 does not escape the $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'] parameter before outputting it back in an attribute, which could lead to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting in old web browsers. 2025-09-22 not yet calculated CVE-2025-9115 https://wpscan.com/vulnerability/67721fa5-4d4f-468b-aa77-c406e68fcf17/ Seagate--Toolkit In Seagate Toolkit on Windows a vulnerability exists in the Toolkit Installer prior to versions 2.35.0.6 where it attempts to load DLLs from the current working directory without validating their origin or integrity. This behavior can be exploited by placing a malicious DLL in the same directory as the installer executable, leading to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running the installer. The issue stems from the use of insecure DLL loading practices, such as relying on relative paths or failing to specify fully qualified paths when invoking system libraries. 2025-09-26 not yet calculated CVE-2025-9267 https://www.seagate.com/product-security/#security-advisories https://www.seagate.com/support/software/toolkit/ Unknown--Admin and Site Enhancements (ASE) The Admin and Site Enhancements (ASE) WordPress plugin before 7.9.8 does not sanitise SVG files when uploaded via xmlrpc.php when such uploads are enabled, which could allow users to upload a malicious SVG containing XSS payloads 2025-09-22 not yet calculated CVE-2025-9487 https://wpscan.com/vulnerability/b957b7c4-7a7c-497e-b8e4-499c821fb1b0/ Viessmann--Vitogate 300 An OS command injection vulnerability has been discovered in the Vitogate 300, which can be exploited by malicious users to compromise affected installations. Specifically, the `/cgi-bin/vitogate.cgi` endpoint is affected, when the `form` JSON parameter is set to `form-0-2`. The vulnerability stems from the fact that that function at offset 0x21c24 does not properly sanitize supplied input before interpolating it into a format string which gets passed to `popen()`. Consequently, an authenticated attacker is able to inject arbitrary OS commands and thus gain code execution on affected devices. 2025-09-23 not yet calculated CVE-2025-9494 https://www.corporate.carrier.com/product-security/advisories-resources/ Viessmann--Vitogate 300 The Vitogate 300 web interface fails to enforce proper server-side authentication and relies on frontend-based authentication controls. This allows an attacker to simply modify HTML elements in the browser's developer tools to bypass login restrictions. By removing specific UI elements, an attacker can reveal the hidden administration menu, giving them full control over the device. 2025-09-23 not yet calculated CVE-2025-9495 https://https://www.corporate.carrier.com/product-security/advisories-resources/ Unknown--Markup Markdown The Markup Markdown WordPress plugin before 3.20.10 allows links to contain JavaScript which could allow users with the contributor role and above to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks. 2025-09-22 not yet calculated CVE-2025-9540 https://wpscan.com/vulnerability/79e606df-50a0-4639-b2d9-4a77111fd729/ Unknown--Markup Markdown The Markup Markdown WordPress plugin before 3.20.10 allows links to contain JavaScript which could allow users with the contributor role and above to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks. 2025-09-22 not yet calculated CVE-2025-9541 https://wpscan.com/vulnerability/3828b320-9f7b-4a2a-a6b0-200b023d602c/ Salesforce--Salesforce CLI Uncontrolled Search Path Element vulnerability in Salesforce Salesforce CLI on Windows allows Replace Trusted Executable.This issue affects Salesforce CLI: before 2.106.6. 2025-09-23 not yet calculated CVE-2025-9844 https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=005224301&type=1 is-localhost-ip--is-localhost-ip A restriction bypass vulnerability in is-localhost-ip could allow attackers to perform Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF).
