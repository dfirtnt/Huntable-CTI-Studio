# Test Failure Help — Read Reports First

When the user asks for help with test failures, **do not begin by re-running the test.**

Start by **reading the existing failure artifacts** (from the most recent run), in this order:

1. **Failure log** — `test-results/failures_*.log` (latest by timestamp)
2. **HTML report** — `test-results/report_*.html` (latest)
3. **JUnit XML** — `test-results/junit_*.xml` (latest)

Example paths from a typical run:

- Failure details: `test-results/failures_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.log`
- HTML report: `test-results/report_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.html`
- JUnit XML: `test-results/junit_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.xml`
- Allure: `allure serve allure-results` (if Allure is used)

Use the most recent timestamped files. Only re-run tests after reviewing these artifacts when you need to confirm a fix or reproduce after changes.
