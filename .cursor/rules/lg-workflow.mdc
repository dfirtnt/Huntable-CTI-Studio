# LG (Looks Good) Workflow

When the user says **lg** or **LG**, **you must run the full workflow yourself** from hygiene through **push to main**. Do not stop at commit or ask the user to push manually.

Perform in order:

1. **Full hygiene** (so the commit includes these updates):
   - **Changelog** — Update CHANGELOG (or docs/CHANGELOG.md) with this session’s changes.
   - **Docs** — Ensure docs reflect changes (README, GETTING_STARTED, or touched features).
   - **Deps** — Verify dependency hygiene (e.g. `pip check`, lockfiles).
   - **Security** — Run project security checks if defined (e.g. `npm audit`, safety).
2. **Stage** — `git add` (or equivalent) so all changes are staged.
3. **Commit** — Commit with a clear message (no auto-commit before user says LG).
4. **Push** — Push to **main** (e.g. `git push origin main`). Complete the push; do not hand off to the user.

If the environment’s `git` wrapper breaks (e.g. unsupported `--trailer`), use the real git binary (e.g. `/usr/local/bin/git`) so the workflow completes.

Only run this workflow when the user has said LG. Do not commit/push on "go" or "implement" unless they also say LG.
