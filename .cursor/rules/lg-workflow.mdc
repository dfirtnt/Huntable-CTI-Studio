# LG (Looks Good) Workflow

When the user says **lg** or **LG**, perform in order:

1. **Commit** — Stage and commit current changes with a clear message (no auto-commit before user says LG).
2. **Push** — Push to the configured remote (e.g. `origin main`).
3. **Full hygiene**:
   - **Security** — Run project security checks / audit if defined (e.g. `npm audit`, safety, or repo-specific).
   - **Deps** — Verify or update dependency hygiene (e.g. `pip freeze`, `requirements-pinned.txt`, lockfiles).
   - **Docs** — Ensure docs reflect changes (README, GETTING_STARTED, or touched features).
   - **Changelog** — Update CHANGELOG (or docs/CHANGELOG.md) with this session’s changes.

Only commit and push when the user has said LG. Do not commit/push on "go" or "implement" unless they also say LG.
